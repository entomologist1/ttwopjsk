2,,,,Oh oh oh! That musician is back!,,,,,,,,,
2,,,,"(I saw a bit of their performance the other day, but I only arrived in the middle of their last song.)",,,,,,,,,
2,,,,Yay~♪ I hope they play some more this time.,,,,,,,,,
3,,,,"Ooooh, the band on that billboard, I think I've seen them before…",,,,,,,,,
3,,,,Leo/need… Leo/need… Um…,,,,,,,,,
3,,,,Oh yeah! Hiroshi and I saw them at Jamfest last year. The one with the really cool frontman! ,,,,,,,,,
3,,,,Not as cool as DIOS though.,,,,,,,,,
4,,,,"Oh, Nightcord tweeted something!",,,,,,,,,
4,,,,Looks like they're celebrating their anniversary soon.,,,,,,,,,
4,,,,"(They've been on hiatus for a while. It makes sense, though. I think most of them are in uni now...)",,,,,,,,,
4,,,,"(Still, I'm glad they remembered their fans.)",,,,,,,,,
4,,,,Maybe I should rearrange one of their songs as a tribute.,,,,,,,,,
5,,,,(Too many people…),,,,,,,,,
5,,,,"(I just wanted to pick up age of audio's new single, but apparently, this is rush hour for all the most annoying, inconvinent people in the city.)",,,,,,,,,
5,,,,(—Ugh! The light is green! You can walk and take pictures at the same time!),,,,,,,,,
5,,,,(Move!!!),,,,,,,,,
6,,,,There's still a tag on this hat…,,,,,,,,,
6,,,,(Mayuko gave me this weird looking shark hat completely out of the blue…),,,,,,,,,
6,,,,"(I mean. she means well, but I don't think I'm ever going to wear this. Like, ever.)",,,,,,,,,
6,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
6,,,,*sigh*…,,,,,,,,,
6,,,,(Nevermind. I'll find something to do with it.),,,,,,,,,
7,,,,This is bullshit. I'm basically an adult. Why does it matter if I'm not wearing the uniform?,,,,,,,,,
7,,,,"They should have a day where everyone can wear what they want. Make it a spirit day, or something.",,,,,,,,,
7,,,,"...Actually, that might get chaotic.",,,,,,,,,
8,,,,(Ohhhhhhh no.),,,,,,,,,
8,,,,"(I reached out to that guy for a gig last month, and I totally forgot to follow up with him on it.)",,,,,,,,,
8,,,,(I don't think he noticed me yet. Maybe…),,,,,,,,,
8,,,,"Excuse me, sorry, just need to get past you...",,,,,,,,,
9,,,,You'd think Miku would spend some time cleaning this place… ,,,,,,,,,
9,,,,"I borrowed one of her headphones, but the supply closet's such a mess. I don't even know where this is supposed to go.",,,,,,,,,
9,,,,"…Blah, I give up. She can deal with it.",,,,,,,,,
10,,,,(That billboard...),,,,,,,,,
10,,,,"(age of audio just released a single, so obviously, they're going to market it.)",,,,,,,,,
10,,,,(I wonder if the others got a copy…),,,,,,,,,
10,,,,"(…No, I can't think about that. I have my own responsibilities to handle.)",,,,,,,,,
11,,,,"Oh, these shirts are cute. Especially the one with the floral accents. Should I get it..? ",,,,,,,,,
11,,,,I don't know when I'd get a chance to wear them though. Most of the time I'm working in the dark.,,,,,,,,,
11,,,,Hmm…,,,,,,,,,
11,,,,Maybe I'll save it for a slow day. ,,,,,,,,,
12,,,,Jesus Christ above— are we a bunch of animals?!,,,,,,,,,
12,,,,Who leaves their headphones on the ground for anyone to trip over??,,,,,,,,,
12,,,,"(Usually, I'd blame Yurina, but apparently Miku's just as bad...)",,,,,,,,,
12,,,,"Fine then. If she won't clean this place up, then I guess I will.",,,,,,,,,
13,,,,I shouldn't have offered to take that shift... I completely forgot about the math homework.,,,,,,,,,
13,,,,Maybe Mayuko will let me copy hers..?,,,,,,,,,
13,,,,"...No, nevermind. I can't have her thinking I don't take my studies seriously.",,,,,,,,,
13,,,,I'll just finish it now and hope she goes easy on me...,,,,,,,,,
14,,,,First I overslept. Then I forgot to pack my math textbook this morning.,,,,,,,,,
14,,,,"Then I had to borrow from Chiyomi, because I forgot to bring money for lunch…",,,,,,,,,
14,,,,And now I'm going to be late to my shift!!!,,,,,,,,,
14,,,,"Seriously, what the hell! Who did I piss off? Did I do something in a past life to deserve all this?!",,,,,,,,,
14,,An Ominous Visage from God,\,*somehow i play danganronpa music here*,,,,,,,,,
14,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
15,,,,Miku?,,,,,,,,,
15,,,,"(Hmm, I can't find her outside…)",,,,,,,,,
15,,,,"(Does that mean she's in the building? She always says that she's skipping class when she's out here, but…)",,,,,,,,,
15,,,,"(I mean, no way she actually has classes to attend! What would she even be learning? Who would be teaching?)",,,,,,,,,
15,,,,"(…But if she is, that means it must be important. I shouldn't take her away from her education.) ",,,,,,,,,
15,,,,"Nevermind, I'll just find her later.",,,,,,,,,
16,,,,Support classes are over… ,,,,,,,,,
16,,,,"(I'm supposed to go right back to homeroom, but no one's caught me coming out here yet…)",,,,,,,,,
16,,,,…Just until my headache goes away.,,,,,,,,,
16,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
16,,,,The courtyard's really nice without all the noise…,,,,,,,,,
17,,,,"Oh, the line for the pop-up cafe is really long…",,,,,,,,,
17,,,,(I wish school didn't go on for so long… I could've lined up earlier.),,,,,,,,,
17,,,,"...*Sigh* The pain of having your niche series blow up, I guess.",,,,,,,,,
17,,,,I hope there's merch left…,,,,,,,,,
18,,,,I don't have a reason to be here. ,,,,,,,,,
18,,,,I should just go home. I should at least try the assignment. I should at least turn in something…,,,,,,,,,
18,,,,...,,,,,,,,,
18,,,,Forget it…,,,,,,,,,
19,,,,(I shouldn't have signed up for this...),,,,,,,,,
19,,,,"(I only joined the disciplinary committee to get out of class easier, but actually marking people up is a pain.)",,,,,,,,,
19,,,,(Why can't everyone just do what they're told?),,,,,,,,,
19,,,,"...! Hey, that's not the uniform!",,,,,,,,,
19,,,,Wha— Come back!!!,,,,,,,,,
20,,,,"Yuuka and Akari are with their friends, so I have some time to kill.",,,,,,,,,
20,,,,"Mmm, I kinda don't want to do homework though… It's such a nice day outside!",,,,,,,,,
20,,,,"I'd go for a proper run, but I can't leave the girls out of my sight. I'll just do laps around the playground.",,,,,,,,,
21,,,,Council meeting is over… ,,,,,,,,,
21,,,,"Oh no, that went on for way too long! I'm going to be late to pick up the girls.",,,,,,,,,
21,,,,Maybe I should ask Toshiki to…,,,,,,,,,
21,,,,"—No, I can make it! I'll just have to run! ",,,,,,,,,
22,,,,"Honestly, I didn't even have to come back to class. There's only half an hour before school lets out.",,,,,,,,,
22,,,,"...But there's a meeting today, and Sanae's coming all the way from Kamiyama. I can't be skipping just for the hell of it.",,,,,,,,,
22,,,,"Besides, what would they do without me? My glorious, guiding presence? I'm practically the heart of the club! ",,,,,,,,,
23,,,,(I survived today's session…),,,,,,,,,
23,,,,"(…Ha, I can talk just fine, but when it comes to anything outside of that…)",,,,,,,,,
23,,,,(I'm such a fraud. How long until everyone realizes…),,,,,,,,,
23,,,,"(…No, I need to calm my nerves. I'll take twenty minutes, then go home.)",,,,,,,,,
24,,,,I don't think they'll find me here.,,,,,,,,,
24,,,,"(Miku and the others are nice and all, but sometimes, I don't want to entertain them.)",,,,,,,,,
24,,,,"(And when I *do* talk to Miku, she acts so strange. I don't know what she expects from me.)",,,,,,,,,
24,,,,I'll just take five minutes. I have to head back out soon.,,,,,,,,,
25,,,,I do wish the music room wasn't so busy during lunch. I'd like to get some practice in before the period ends.,,,,,,,,,
25,,,,"Usually, there's people in the classrooms, so I can't go there. And I already practice outside, so the rooftop isn't ideal either. ",,,,,,,,,
25,,,,"(Actually, Sanae might get on my case about not eating lunch again...)",,,,,,,,,
25,,,,Nevermind. I'll just wait until afterschool to practice.,,,,,,,,,
26,,,,I got chased out...,,,,,,,,,
26,,,,(I didn't need a permit to perform here before... When did they implement that?),,,,,,,,,
26,,,,"(...Why does this keep happening? Everything, always changing. Is nothing sacred anymore..?)",,,,,,,,,
26,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
26,,,,...It can't be helped. I'll head to the park and practice there.,,,,,,,,,
27,,,,— ♪,,,,,,,,,
27,,,,(That was passable.),,,,,,,,,
27,,,,"(Usually, my wrist and shoulder would be hurting at this point. I suppose Rion had a point about my posture...)",,,,,,,,,
27,,,,Alright. Once more.,,,,,,,,,
28,,,,"(Usually, the hall monitors get on my case about following the dress code...",,,,,,,,,
28,,,,"...But ever since the blonde one saw me with Toshiki, she's been looking the other way.)",,,,,,,,,
28,,,,KYAHAHA! The power of connections!,,,,,,,,,
28,,,,"I dunno what Toshiki did, but I should thank him~",,,,,,,,,
29,,,,Oh. My. God.,,,,,,,,,
29,,,,This chew toy is SO CUTE!!! What a cute little face!!!,,,,,,,,,
29,,,,"I know these are for dogs to, like, chew on… but maybe Bonbon would want it?",,,,,,,,,
29,,,,"…Eek, nevermind. Totally forgot about my spending plan.",,,,,,,,,
29,,,,"Bonbon isn't a hunter, anyway. The worst he'd do is throw it around when he's mad.",,,,,,,,,
29,,,,"…Wait, that would be really cute too…",,,,,,,,,
30,,,,"Hmph, the cool store clerk isn't here today…",,,,,,,,,
30,,,,"I wasn't really planning on buying anything today, TBH. I only came here to tell her about the band.",,,,,,,,,
30,,,,"Maybe I should, like, actually get her LINE…",,,,,,,,,
30,,,,"…WAHHhh, too scary! Forget it, I'll just windowshop and go home.",,,,,,,,,
31,,,,"For some reason, the others never hang out in the music room during lunch.",,,,,,,,,
31,,,,There's a lot of friendly people here! And the atmosphere's really nice!,,,,,,,,,
31,,,,"Though, it's kinda a free-for-all in here. Maybe they don't like the chaos. ",,,,,,,,,
31,,,,"...Alright! Next time, I'll invite Toshiki and the others to have lunch here! We'll totally fit in.",,,,,,,,,
32,,,,I haven't been to that instrument shop in a while...,,,,,,,,,
32,,,,"When I was trying out for brass band, I'd go there almost every week. But now I just borrow the school's drumkit.",,,,,,,,,
32,,,,I wonder how the owner's doing...,,,,,,,,,
32,,,,"Actually, I think I'll visit soon! I need to get a drumkit of my own, anyway.",,,,,,,,,
32,,,,Somehow…,,,,,,,,,
33,,,,"(Ugh, I came all the way out here, but I still can't decide…)",,,,,,,,,
33,,,,"(If I go to shopping mall, I can go to that one curry place Ami recommended, but then it'll take an extra time to go to the grocery store and get groceries…)",,,,,,,,,
33,,,,"(But if I get groceries first, it might take too long, and they'll close for the night…)",,,,,,,,,
33,,,,"(But it shouldn't take me that long, unless there's a line…)",,,,,,,,,
33,,,,(But do I really want to carry around groceries all the way across the city?),,,,,,,,,
33,,,,! ,,,,,,,,,
33,,,,"Sorry, sorry!! I'm going…",,,,,,,,,
34,,,,…I'm real behind. ,,,,,,,,,
34,,,,"You miss one lesson, and everyone in English is suddenly Shakespeare. ",,,,,,,,,
34,,,,But I can't keep relying on Toshiki… and I don't think anyone else in the class wants to share their notes. ,,,,,,,,,
34,,,,…Whatever. Self-study it is.,,,,,,,,,
35,,,,I hope that one guitar place's still open. They had strings for a good price.,,,,,,,,,
35,,,,"I really need to get back into practice. It's been so long since I last played properly, I've lost my callouses. ",,,,,,,,,
35,,,,(And everyone's been so diligent about their instruments… I can't mess this up for them too.),,,,,,,,,
36,,,,— ♪,,,,,,,,,
36,,,,(Toshiki's right. This is a good place to practice.),,,,,,,,,
36,,,,"(I thought it would be busy, but it's empty on this side. And it's an open area. I can be sure that no one's following me…)",,,,,,,,,
36,,,,(…I need to get over myself.),,,,,,,,,
36,,,,"(If we're going to perform as a band, I can't be holding them back.)",,,,,,,,,
37,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
37,,,,"(Everything's gotten so lively, all of a sudden.)",,,,,,,,,
37,,,,"(It's *so* annoying. Seriously, who the hell do they think they are?)",,,,,,,,,
37,,,,(I was doing fine before they showed up. They desecrated my place just so they can practice.),,,,,,,,,
37,,,,"(…At least they're good company. If they ever get boring, I'm kicking em out.)",,,,,,,,,
38,,,,"A-one, and a-two, and—",,,,,,,,,
38,,,,(Yay! I got the kick and twirl right! Usually I spin too much and mess up my position for the next part.),,,,,,,,,
38,,,,(I can probably get this part down by the end of the day!—),,,,,,,,,
38,,,,*Distant explosion*,,,,,,,,,
38,,,,(Aww… I spoke too soon…),,,,,,,,,
39,,,,"Oh, this display…",,,,,,,,,
39,,,,"(I put up a sign not to mess with the exhibits, but someone's been in here. The belt on this stanchion isn't supposed to connect here.)",,,,,,,,,
39,,,,*click*,,,,,,,,,
39,,,,(…Good. They need to learn to rebel a little.),,,,,,,,,
40,,,,Hi~ro~shi! Thanks for coming!,,,,,,,,,
40,,,,You're lucky I haven't been escorted out yet. Why couldn't I just meet you at the gate?,,,,,,,,,
40,,,,"But the teacher wanted me for something, and you would've had to wait outside for a while. At least here you can sit down and relax.",,,,,,,,,
40,,,,?!?!?! That's it?!?!?! I could've gotten kicked out! ,,,,,,,,,
40,,,,"Well, you didn't, so it all worked out in the end. Let's go!",,,,,,,,,
40,,,,"Yeah, let's get out of here…",,,,,,,,,
41,,,,Hiroshi!!!,,,,,,,,,
41,,,,"Oh, sure. Just come on in. Not like you'll get me in trouble if anyone sees you. ",,,,,,,,,
41,,,,"Relax, it's not like anyone cares. Besides, you got to see my campus, so I wanna see yours!",,,,,,,,,
41,,,,You can see my school when we have the festival. Just wait at the gate next time.,,,,,,,,,
41,,,,Waaaah… I'm so lonely… Hiroshi doesn't want to hang out with me…,,,,,,,,,
41,,,,We're literally going to meet up with Yurina and Raika right now. ,,,,,,,,,
41,,,,Oh yeah. Yay ★,,,,,,,,,
42,,,,"So yeah, I had to do the homework during my lunch period. It sucked.",,,,,,,,,
42,,,,"On the bright side, I totally thought I was going to get a 0, but look! I passed★",,,,,,,,,
42,,,,"You got a 70%, what the hell are you so proud for? Do your homework on time.",,,,,,,,,
42,,,,"Not what you're supposed to say. You should be praising me for my quick thinking, or for working well under pressure.",,,,,,,,,
42,,,,"...Ok. Since you're such a genius, how about you help me with my math homework?",,,,,,,,,
42,,,,Okay!,,,,,,,,,
42,,,,(She agreed to that way too quickly...),,,,,,,,,
43,,,,"I was thinking, what if we made flyers? ",,,,,,,,,
43,,,,Flyers? We don't even have any sets ready. ,,,,,,,,,
43,,,,"I mean, yeah, but for practice! For when we do put on a set! ",,,,,,,,,
43,,,,I'd rather practice beatmatching. The part that people actually care about?,,,,,,,,,
43,,,,You're no fun… I *know* that. It's about manifesting it for us! Believing in ourselves! ,,,,,,,,,
43,,,,"…I'll think about it. Raika might be better at graphic design, though. ",,,,,,,,,
44,,,,"Ooooh, Hiroshi, look! Let's try one!",,,,,,,,,
44,,,,A capsule machine? I don't know any of these characters.,,,,,,,,,
44,,,,Me neither! But the blue one with the face mask looks cool.,,,,,,,,,
44,,,,"Aww, didn't get her… Hiroshi, you like can badges, you should try!",,,,,,,,,
44,,,,I'm not gonna waste my money on a character I don't even know. What are you going to do with that?,,,,,,,,,
44,,,,Uh… I was gonna give it to you.,,,,,,,,,
44,,,,Figured. Maybe you can use it for DIY.,,,,,,,,,
45,,,,I wonder how big this place actually is?,,,,,,,,,
45,,,,"I mean, the main area isn't that much bigger than VISR's, but I don't think I've explored the entire back yet.",,,,,,,,,
45,,,,"Dude, this place is huge as is. I've been to livehouses smaller than this place's lobby.",,,,,,,,,
45,,,,It's just that half of the space is a mess. I don't think we can get past all those cables without shears.,,,,,,,,,
45,,,,"Yeah, maybe we should focus on where we are now.",,,,,,,,,
46,,,,Yurina!!,,,,,,,,,
46,,,,Mayuko? What's up? I don't think we're meeting today—,,,,,,,,,
46,,,,Wanna come with me to the music shop? age of audio's new single is out!!,,,,,,,,,
46,,,,"I'm just on my way to buy it! There's a deluxe edition too, but there's a limited amount, so I wanted to try and—",,,,,,,,,
46,,,,You already got it?!?!,,,,,,,,,
46,,,,Ha! Who's DIOS' number one fan now?,,,,,,,,,
46,,,,"…Hey, I'm just kidding. I bought it in a moment of weakness. Here.",,,,,,,,,
46,,,,Really? I can just have it?,,,,,,,,,
46,,,,"Yeah, I'm not gonna use it. I'll just get a download if I need a copy.",,,,,,,,,
46,,,,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,,,,,,,,,
46,,,,Yurina!!!!!!!!!! Thank you!! You're the best!!,,,,,,,,,
47,,,,"Yurina, you're always so busy. How'd you do it? You must be super popular!",,,,,,,,,
47,,,,You're giving me too much credit. I'm not *that* popular… ,,,,,,,,,
47,,,,"Honestly, it's mostly talking to people. Keep putting yourself out there, and someone will take you up.",,,,,,,,,
47,,,,It's even better if someone else puts in a good word for you. Then you really need to do your best.,,,,,,,,,
47,,,,"Oh, really? That's easy★ Can you put a good word for Hiro and I?",,,,,,,,,
47,,,,"Uh… Let's save making connections for later. First, you have to actually know what you're doing. ",,,,,,,,,
47,,,,"(Also, I don't think my word really means anything…)",,,,,,,,,
48,,,,"You don't need to jump right into trying CDJs, y'know. A regular controller is fine for now, and way cheaper.",,,,,,,,,
48,,,,Really? Phew! I thought I'd have to save up again.,,,,,,,,,
48,,,,"You said you bought a new guitar recently, too… Do you *always* buy stuff on impulse?",,,,,,,,,
48,,,,"Hey, I'm not that careless. Obviously I save my money.",,,,,,,,,
48,,,,"I've wanted this specific model for a *long* time, so it's not like I have any regrets. If I needed a CDJ, I would've just saved up for that too.",,,,,,,,,
48,,,,I don't think you know how much it would cost… But at least you have some self-control.,,,,,,,,,
49,,,,"Mayuko, you have a dog too?",,,,,,,,,
49,,,,"Yep! Actually, he just kinda shows up around our neighborhood, but he's basically mine. He really likes me.",,,,,,,,,
49,,,,"His name is Bandit. He's got these cool markings around his face, it makes him look like he's wearing a bandit mask!",,,,,,,,,
49,,,,"Huh. Never heard of a breed with markings like that. Mine's a corgi, but my brother was boring. He named him Fido. ",,,,,,,,,
49,,,,"That's cute though!! They should meet up! Once I get Bandit on a collar, we can have a puppy playdate! ",,,,,,,,,
49,,,,Does he not have a collar..?,,,,,,,,,
49,,,,"I mean, I bought one for him. But everytime I try to put it on, he gets super mean and growls at me. ",,,,,,,,,
49,,,,(Growls?!),,,,,,,,,
49,,,,"…Uh, sure. I'll think about it.",,,,,,,,,
49,,,,"(Sorry Mayuko, but your dog doesn't really sound tame…)",,,,,,,,,
50,,,,"Yurina, have you ever been here before? Like, before we showed you this place.",,,,,,,,,
50,,,,"Uh, no. Why?",,,,,,,,,
50,,,,"Just curious! I mean, Miku said something about a previous SEKAI owner, but whenever I try to ask, she just tells me to leave her alone.",,,,,,,,,
50,,,,"So I've been trying to investigate! How about Raika, do you think it's her? ",,,,,,,,,
50,,,,"...Yeah, no, I don't think she's going to entertain that. She'll probably tell you to focus on your sets.",,,,,,,,,
50,,,,Aww... That was all my leads.,,,,,,,,,
50,,,,"...Hey, be careful who you talk to about SEKAI. Miku barely tolerates us as is, she's not gonna want anyone else involved.",,,,,,,,,
50,,,,"I am careful! Whatever, I'll just talk to Hiroshi, he's smart.",,,,,,,,,
51,,,,I bet I could drive. I'd be so good at driving.,,,,,,,,,
51,,,,? Where is this coming from? Has Yurina been giving you ideas?,,,,,,,,,
51,,,,"No, I was just thinking about it while waiting for the light to turn green.",,,,,,,,,
51,,,,"If I could drive, I could be a tour bus driver and drive bands around! It's like, being paid for backstage access!",,,,,,,,,
51,,,,You do realize that there's a separate license for driving a bus. That'll take years to get.,,,,,,,,,
51,,,,"I *know* that, I'm just thinking about it. It's called planning for the future.",,,,,,,,,
51,,,,"Wait, what was that about Yurina? Does *she* know how to drive?",,,,,,,,,
51,,,,"Nevermind, ignore that. Don't start driving until you're old enough for a license.",,,,,,,,,
52,,,,This place again? Don't you go anywhere else?,,,,,,,,,
52,,,,"What's wrong with it? You said you liked their sandwiches, didn't you?",,,,,,,,,
52,,,,"Well, yeah, but it gets boring going to the same place everyday.",,,,,,,,,
52,,,,You're just like Yurina. I'm not trying to be exciting. I'm just here to get my coffee and go.,,,,,,,,,
52,,,,I know! There's a super cool crepe place down the street. I'll grab you one!,,,,,,,,,
52,,,,No thanks.,,,,,,,,,
52,,,,"Ok, well I want crepes, so I'm going anyway. Be right back!",,,,,,,,,
52,,,,Mayuko! ,,,,,,,,,
52,,,,"…And she's gone. Seriously, that girl can't sit still for a minute.",,,,,,,,,
53,,,,"Hey Raika, the guys in this ad… didn't they play at VISR before? Like, a super long time ago? ",,,,,,,,,
53,,,,"Oh, you remember them? It must've been years ago... They used to be regulars before they got signed on.",,,,,,,,,
53,,,,Wow… And now their music's being played everywhere… ,,,,,,,,,
53,,,,"Raika, you're so cool★",,,,,,,,,
53,,,,? Why are you telling me this? I'm not part of the band.,,,,,,,,,
53,,,,"Yeah, but like, you basically helped get them off the ground. You're like, a part of their origin story!",,,,,,,,,
53,,,,I'm not that important. There's no shortage of venues for people to perform at.  ,,,,,,,,,
53,,,,"I'm glad it worked out for them, though. They really put in their all. I knew they'd get somewhere.",,,,,,,,,
53,,,,"(Hehe, she's being sentimental…) ",,,,,,,,,
54,,,,"Ok, we need to lay down some ground rules if we're going to practice in SEKAI.",,,,,,,,,
54,,,,No getting on the stage until I check it over. Even if Miku gives you the okay.,,,,,,,,,
54,,,,No trying to fix anything on your own if it's broken.,,,,,,,,,
54,,,,No breaking into rooms that aren't unlocked.,,,,,,,,,
54,,,,No getting Yurina to break into rooms that aren't unlocked.,,,,,,,,,
54,,,,"Seriously, all these rules… It's not like the SEKAI's going to explode on us.",,,,,,,,,
54,,,,"You don't know that, and I'm not going to risk it. God knows what Miku cut corners on.",,,,,,,,,
54,,,,"Anyway, no pressing any buttons you don't know—",,,,,,,,,
54,,,,And shouldn't Hiroshi be here for this too?!,,,,,,,,,
55,,,,Hehe…,,,,,,,,,
55,,,,You're in a good mood today. Did something happen?,,,,,,,,,
55,,,,Not really. I was just thinking… ,,,,,,,,,
55,,,,"In the past, I used to see people perform up on stage, and go to and from practice, and hang out in livehouses… ",,,,,,,,,
55,,,,"Being online is fun and all, but I wanted to be a part of that so badly, you know?",,,,,,,,,
55,,,,"...You'll get there, Mayuko. ",,,,,,,,,
55,,,,"No, I mean, it feels like I've gotten it.",,,,,,,,,
55,,,,"I'm glad you and Yurina are helping us with this. Without you two, I think we'd be, like, totally lost. ",,,,,,,,,
55,,,,"…I'm happy to hear it, Mayuko. I'll do my best for you. ",,,,,,,,,
56,,,,You're emphasizing the wrong syllable. You're saying it like you're producing a track. ,,,,,,,,,
56,,,,"It's a noun, so you have to say it like PRO-duce. Like, [i]there's a discount on the produce here.[/i]",,,,,,,,,
56,,,,…I'm cooked. The oral exam's tomorrow. No way am I going to figure this out by then.,,,,,,,,,
56,,,,"What? No, don't say that. Other than that, you're doing fine.",,,,,,,,,
56,,,,I'm just nitpicking. She probably won't care about stuff like that.,,,,,,,,,
56,,,,Really?,,,,,,,,,
56,,,,"Beats me. I don't pay attention to the rubric. English is like, the one class I don't have to worry about.",,,,,,,,,
56,,,,"...Great. Thanks anyway, Yurina.",,,,,,,,,
57,,,,So like. Is there a reason why Raika's always looking at you like that?,,,,,,,,,
57,,,,?!?!?!?!?!?!,,,,,,,,,
57,,,,The fuck? You can't just say that and not elaborate?,,,,,,,,,
57,,,,Like you're going to do something stupid if she's not watching you 24/7.,,,,,,,,,
57,,,,"Oh, that. Nah, she's just a control freak. She's like that with everyone who performs at VISR. I think it's a liability thing.",,,,,,,,,
57,,,,"I don't really mind, though, if it makes her feel better. It's not like I'm planning on throwing myself into the crowd. ",,,,,,,,,
57,,,,That's… so interesting.,,,,,,,,,
58,,,,I might have to go back and buy one of those windbreakers. I really liked the red one's design.,,,,,,,,,
58,,,,You're not gonna get one?,,,,,,,,,
58,,,,"They're nice, I guess... Wish I could actually wear them to school, though.",,,,,,,,,
58,,,,"Ugh, I feel you. They'd totally get confiscated. Actually, I can't stand the whole uniform thing in general.",,,,,,,,,
58,,,,"I got a warning for wearing a t-shirt under my blazer the other day. Like, I had a gig right after! Did they want me to show up in my school uniform?",,,,,,,,,
58,,,,"Right? I mean, I only go outside for school, but it'd be nice to wear what I want, at least. ",,,,,,,,,
58,,,,"That's why we have to get you out of the house more. So you can wear clothes you like, instead of being stuck in uniform all the time.",,,,,,,,,
58,,,,Ugh… I guess when you put it like that…,,,,,,,,,
59,,,,What the hell was that for? You completely ditched me.,,,,,,,,,
59,,,,"Sorryyyy… Something came up, that's all.",,,,,,,,,
59,,,,Was it so urgent that you couldn't even give me a headsup? What were you even doing?,,,,,,,,,
59,,,,…I just saw someone I didn't want to talk to. ,,,,,,,,,
59,,,,You were *hiding*?,,,,,,,,,
59,,,,"I was being considerate! If she saw that I was here, it would've become a whole thing. I didn't want to ruin your day.",,,,,,,,,
59,,,,…Nevermind. I don't even want to know what drama you're involved in.,,,,,,,,,
60,,,,"Honestly, I think you've got the hang of this! Maybe we'll try putting you in front of a crowd next. ",,,,,,,,,
60,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
60,,,,"Hey, don't look so pale. It doesn't need to be on a big stage like VISR.",,,,,,,,,
60,,,,"Most of the time, I'm doing events and parties. And in that case, no one's gonna focus too hard on you.",,,,,,,,,
60,,,,Really? I guess that sounds managable…,,,,,,,,,
60,,,,Exactly! Nothing to worry about. You're just there to keep the music playing and the energy high.,,,,,,,,,
60,,,,"As long as you don't make any stupid decisions, no one'll even look at you.",,,,,,,,,
60,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
60,,,,"—In the sense that, you're not gonna make any stupid decisions.",,,,,,,,,
60,,,,Ahhhhhhhh…,,,,,,,,,
61,,,,What happened here? The plastic on this is all blackened. ,,,,,,,,,
61,,,,Oh yeah. The LED panel started smoking when Raika was testing her setup.,,,,,,,,,
61,,,,"Raika wanted to check around for a replacement, so we just kept it here for now…",,,,,,,,,
61,,,,"Oh, I think I might've seen something like that in the back. If you want, I can drag it out here and we can try to install it?",,,,,,,,,
61,,,,"Oh. Actually, that would be really helpful.",,,,,,,,,
61,,,,"I don't know how Raika would feel about us trying to install it on our own, though…",,,,,,,,,
61,,,,"I know she means well, but you don't need her permission for everything. She worries too much as is. ",,,,,,,,,
61,,,,"Besides, I know what I'm doing. I'll be the trusted adult.",,,,,,,,,
61,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
61,,,,"…Okay, fine. Lead the way.",,,,,,,,,
62,,,,"Hiroshi, I didn't see you at lunch the other day. Is everything ok?",,,,,,,,,
62,,,,"Wh— Huh? We don't even eat together, why are you keeping track of where I spend lunch?",,,,,,,,,
62,,,,"You say that like you're hard to find. You usually sit in the same spot, so I noticed when you weren't there.",,,,,,,,,
62,,,,"Ok, first of all, still weird. Second of all, I was studying with a classmate yesterday. I don't need to be micromanaged, or whatever you're doing. ",,,,,,,,,
62,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
62,,,,"…That's on me. Sorry about that, Hiroshi. I'm used to keeping tabs on Yurina. ",,,,,,,,,
62,,,,"You're good. Though I don't think she needs to be micromanaged, either.",,,,,,,,,
62,,,,It's not *micromanaging.* It's making sure she's not slacking off. It's what any good friend would do.,,,,,,,,,
62,,,,…If you say so.,,,,,,,,,
63,,,,Are you okay?! Were they harassing you?,,,,,,,,,
63,,,,"No, not really… I just couldn't find a way out of the conversation.",,,,,,,,,
63,,,,"God, I can't stand those types of people. Hiroshi, don't let them corner you like that, okay?",,,,,,,,,
63,,,,"I was trying to get away, but they didn't get the hint… I didn't want to be rude…",,,,,,,,,
63,,,,Don't be afraid to be rude to them. They know that you're uncomfortable and they don't care.,,,,,,,,,
63,,,,"Or if you don't want to talk, you don't have to tell them off outright. Just do your best not to engage. Hide in a store you need to.",,,,,,,,,
63,,,,"…Sorry. I mean, that you had to save me.",,,,,,,,,
63,,,,"Oh, don't say that. It's not your fault you didn't know what to do.",,,,,,,,,
63,,,,Just be careful. There are too many dangerous people out there. ,,,,,,,,,
64,,,,"Thanks for picking it up, Hiroshi. I owe you one— Wait…",,,,,,,,,
64,,,,"Huh? Did I get the wrong thing? You wanted a black coffee, right?",,,,,,,,,
64,,,,"No, that's right. Was the cafe I told you about closed?",,,,,,,,,
64,,,,"…Yeah, it was. I didn't want to come back emptyhanded, so…",,,,,,,,,
64,,,,No worries. Yurina's been telling me to try somewhere new anyway.,,,,,,,,,
64,,,,"Let's catch up with the others. I'll pay you back when we get to VISR, ok?",,,,,,,,,
64,,,,"Right, yeah…",,,,,,,,,
64,,,,(How the hell did she tell so quickly? She hardly even looked at the cup.),,,,,,,,,
65,,,,"You know, I'm surprised I haven't seen you at VISR before. ",,,,,,,,,
65,,,,"I remember seeing Mayuko, but I don't think I've seen you around. Unless I don't remember you..?",,,,,,,,,
65,,,,I just don't go to livehouses unless Mayuko drags me into it.,,,,,,,,,
65,,,,"Honestly, I can't stand crowds. I'm awful at cheering. I ruin the energy just being there. ",,,,,,,,,
65,,,,"You're one person, you're not ruining anything. What matters is that you're enjoying yourself. ",,,,,,,,,
65,,,,"…Still, I want to support them properly. If someone built up the courage to perform and the crowd didn't reciprocate, it would be super discouraging.",,,,,,,,,
65,,,,"As long as you aren't there to boo them, I don't see the problem.",,,,,,,,,
65,,,,"In my opinion, you're supporting them just by buying a ticket. You should come by more often.",,,,,,,,,
65,,,,I guess when you put it like that…,,,,,,,,,
65,,,,"(…Still, I think she has a bit of an agenda.)",,,,,,,,,
66,,,,Woah…,,,,,,,,,
66,,,,Are you doing this all live?,,,,,,,,,
66,,,,"The visualizations are generated live. The footage is prerecorded, though.",,,,,,,,,
66,,,,"It's not that impressive. It's meant to supplement an actual performance, but I figured I'd test out my VJing setup here. ",,,,,,,,,
66,,,,"Still, even if the music's not live, it's really immersive…",,,,,,,,,
66,,,,Um… Is that panel supposed to look like it's shorting out?,,,,,,,,,
66,,,,…No. No it's actually shorting out. Fuck.,,,,,,,,,
66,,,,"Hiroshi, can you—",,,,,,,,,
66,,,,I'll get the fire extinguisher.,,,,,,,,,
67,,,,Seriously? You got a warning *again*?,,,,,,,,,
67,,,,Just wear a jacket over the uniform if you hate it that much.,,,,,,,,,
67,,,,"It's not about that, it's about making a statement. It's not like what I wear affects my learning or anything.",,,,,,,,,
67,,,,"It's about picking your battles. Besides, they won't let you wear whatever you want to the workplace either.",,,,,,,,,
67,,,,"Exactly. They should let us cherish our youth, and let me wear my band merch to school.",,,,,,,,,
67,,,,"Ugh. Fine, do what you want.",,,,,,,,,
68,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
68,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
68,,,,(We're at a standoff…),,,,,,,,,
68,,,,(I can't believe this. She's being dense on purpose.),,,,,,,,,
68,,,,…*sigh*,,,,,,,,,
68,,,,CanIhaveyourphysicsnotesfromyesterday.,,,,,,,,,
68,,,,"Oh, so that's why you've been so cold all lunch. I thought you were about to confess~",,,,,,,,,
68,,,,Because it should be obvious?! Do you think I ditch school because I feel like it? ,,,,,,,,,
68,,,,"I just wanted to hear you say it. How am I supposed to know what you want if you don't use your words? Communication, Raika. ",,,,,,,,,
68,,,,"(That's rich, coming from you.)",,,,,,,,,
68,,,,…Right. Thanks. I just hope this isn't on today's quiz.,,,,,,,,,
68,,,,"Of course. Uh, I wrote some of it in English, so let me know if you're confused.",,,,,,,,,
69,,,,Sanae is so responsible. ,,,,,,,,,
69,,,,"She's on the student council and the disciplinary committee, and she's always helping out in class…",,,,,,,,,
69,,,,"Huh? I mean, yeah, but what she does have to do with anything—",,,,,,,,,
69,,,,You can't even tell someone when you have to cancel a gig! ,,,,,,,,,
69,,,,"Seriously, can you *please* start showing up? I can't have people at VISR's door because they get in contact with you.",,,,,,,,,
69,,,,"…Right. Yeah, got it.",,,,,,,,,
69,,,,"(Yeah, she's clueless. But I can't out Sanae like that…)",,,,,,,,,
70,,,,Do you always go to the same cafe? Don't you get bored?,,,,,,,,,
70,,,,"Not really. They have a quick turnaround time, and the atmosphere is nice. I like to answer emails here.",,,,,,,,,
70,,,,"Makes sense. I think I'd feel bad if the workers started preparing my order in advance, though. ",,,,,,,,,
70,,,,"What's bad about that? We both know what I want, so it's efficient for everyone.",,,,,,,,,
70,,,,"What if you want to try something new? Or they change the recipe, and you don't like it anymore? Then you're betraying them.",,,,,,,,,
70,,,,Seriously? Stop worrying about hypotheticals and eat your creme bun.,,,,,,,,,
70,,,,"Alright, alright. But I'm taking you to a cafe of my choice next time.",,,,,,,,,
71,,,,…I kinda wonder what this place looked like before.,,,,,,,,,
71,,,,"Cleaner, I'd hope.",,,,,,,,,
71,,,,"No, I'm serious. Miku said the original SEKAI owner abandoned this place before us. So did it always look like this?",,,,,,,,,
71,,,,"If I knew how long ago they left, maybe we can figure out a timeline—",,,,,,,,,
71,,,,"Yurina, I'm not the one to talk to about this.",,,,,,,,,
71,,,,I'm only here because I don't want Mayuko and Hiroshi to get hurt. I don't care about whoever was here before. Talk to one of them about your theories. ,,,,,,,,,
71,,,,…Fair enough. Just curious.,,,,,,,,,
72,,,,What are you doing?,,,,,,,,,
72,,,,"Organizing. The place is a mess. If we're going to practice here, we should at least have a platform we can work with.",,,,,,,,,
72,,,,The hell?? You already have VISR to manage. Tell Miku to do it.,,,,,,,,,
72,,,,"Miku doesn't care. She said so herself. It'll only be another hour, then I'll head out.",,,,,,,,,
72,,,,No way. You're not doing this alone. Let me help.,,,,,,,,,
72,,,,"…Fine. These are ethernet cables, can you take these the storage closet? There's a box labeled ethernet on the bottom shelf. ",,,,,,,,,
72,,,,On it~,,,,,,,,,
72,,,,"Hey, this is kinda nostalgic, isn't it? Remember when we had to do a bunch of chores overnight?",,,,,,,,,
72,,,,"Nostaglic for *you*, maybe. I had to make sure my dad didn't find out about the teenagers crashing on VISR's couch.",,,,,,,,,
72,,,,Yep. Good times.,,,,,,,,,
72,,,,…It was.,,,,,,,,,
73,,,,Mi~ku!,,,,,,,,,
73,,,,Ugh...,,,,,,,,,
73,,,,Don't 'ugh...' me! I need your advice! Does the synth sound good here?,,,,,,,,,
73,,,,"What makes you think I have anything useful to say? I told you, I don't do music anymore.",,,,,,,,,
73,,,,Because you have ears. Now listen.,,,,,,,,,
73,,,,...,,,,,,,,,
73,,,,It would be good if I could actually focus on the synth. The drums are too distracting. It's just a bunch of noise fighting for my attention.,,,,,,,,,
73,,,,"But other than that, it's good? Yay! Thanks, Miku!",,,,,,,,,
73,,,,"Yeah yeah, whatever. Come back when you get someone to mix this properly.",,,,,,,,,
74,,,,Hey Miku! Guess what Yurina got for me!,,,,,,,,,
74,,,,"Actually, she got it for herself, but then she gave it to me anyway. Love her, she's great.",,,,,,,,,
74,,,,I don't care. Go bother Hiroshi about it. ,,,,,,,,,
74,,,,"Ta-da! age of audio's new single, deluxe edition!",,,,,,,,,
74,,,,I don't even want to open it!! The packaging is *so* pretty! Don't you think the cover looks super cool!?,,,,,,,,,
74,,,,"And the vocalist, DIOS, he's literally incredible. I don't know how someone has that much talent. I've been following him since day one, and he has *never* missed. ",,,,,,,,,
74,,,,"So yeah, I'm basically his number one fan—",,,,,,,,,
74,,,,"Miku? Hey, where are you going?!",,,,,,,,,
74,,,,(So rude… Even for her.),,,,,,,,,
75,,,,So like. What do you even do?,,,,,,,,,
75,,,,That's rude.,,,,,,,,,
75,,,,"I mean, you say you run this place, but there hasn't been anyone here for a while. So did you just… stand around?",,,,,,,,,
75,,,,"So what, I need a purpose to exist? That's what you're saying? What about you, what do *you* do? ",,,,,,,,,
75,,,,That's not even what I meant! ,,,,,,,,,
75,,,,"Ugh, nevermind. Forget I said anything.",,,,,,,,,
76,,,,"Okay, internet should be up again. Is it working?",,,,,,,,,
76,,,,"Yep, it is. Thanks, Miku. That was surprisingly helpful of you.",,,,,,,,,
76,,,,Is *everything* a backhanded remark with you?! Can't you say thank you like a normal person?,,,,,,,,,
76,,,,"…Sorry. It's just, I thought you'd ignore me again.",,,,,,,,,
76,,,,"…Yeah, that's fair. Actually, I just wanted the internet back so I can check Twitter. ",,,,,,,,,
76,,,,?! You have a Twitter? Is that allowed?? ,,,,,,,,,
76,,,,"No one's stopped me yet. Also, you really should get USBs for your sets. You can't rely on streaming forever.",,,,,,,,,
76,,,,"Okay okay, I'll get on that. Thanks again. ",,,,,,,,,
76,,,,(Now I kinda wanna know her handle…),,,,,,,,,
77,,,,It kinda sucks that we can't take your things to the real world. I wanna try those CDJs in somewhere like VISR.,,,,,,,,,
77,,,,"You are actually shameless. Those are *my* things, they're not just for you to take wherever.",,,,,,,,,
77,,,,"But it's not like you even use them. I'd return them after, and you wouldn't even know they were gone.",,,,,,,,,
77,,,,And I'm helping you clean up at the same time! It's like a trade. My labor for your equipment.,,,,,,,,,
77,,,,I didn't ask you to do that. Don't take my things without permission.,,,,,,,,,
77,,,,"Yeah, yeah, point recieved.",,,,,,,,,
78,,,,"Miku, your wires are all super frayed. Isn't there a better way to tie them up?",,,,,,,,,
78,,,,"Look, I did the best I could. I had to use cable ties to get it to stay in place. It's too dense to do anything with.",,,,,,,,,
78,,,,We could try braiding them! Or keeping it up in a bun? Could be cute~,,,,,,,,,
78,,,,Hmph. I'd like to see you try. ,,,,,,,,,
78,,,,Bet. I'll buy some more cable ties and be back tomorrow. ,,,,,,,,,
78,,,,Ugh… I walked into that.,,,,,,,,,
78,,,,"Fine. But no cutting anything, and no dying my hair.",,,,,,,,,
79,,,,Did you do all this?,,,,,,,,,
79,,,,You're welcome. Took forever to sort all those wires. Did you really just dump everything into one big storage bin?,,,,,,,,,
79,,,,"So what if I did? Why are you even here, anyway? Don't you have a venue to run?",,,,,,,,,
79,,,,"Nothing's scheduled for today, so I have time.",,,,,,,,,
79,,,,"And *someone* has to do something about this mess. I'm not going to let Hiroshi and Mayuko run around on a messy stage, whether it's here or VISR.",,,,,,,,,
79,,,,Hmph. Whatever. Your problem now.,,,,,,,,,
80,,,,Huh?,,,,,,,,,
80,,,,"(I was going to get rid of all the boxes here, but someone beat me to it?)",,,,,,,,,
80,,,,There. I did my part. Now get out of here.,,,,,,,,,
80,,,,Why did you do that? I had set out the rest of my afternoon to—,,,,,,,,,
80,,,,"Yeah, that's the point. If you're not driving yourself crazy over VISR, you're driving yourself crazy over this place. ",,,,,,,,,
80,,,,So I handled this room for you. Now get out. Enjoy your youth. ,,,,,,,,,
80,,,,This is just one room. The rest of the SEKAI is still a giant mess—,,,,,,,,,
80,,,,Raika. Get out. Or I'll make you.,,,,,,,,,
80,,,,"…Jesus, no need to be dramatic. I'm leaving.",,,,,,,,,
81,,,,Wahhhhh… I'm hopeless… I'm nothing… ,,,,,,,,,
81,,,,"? Hiroshi, why's Mayuko on the floor? Is she okay??",,,,,,,,,
81,,,,She failed her math quiz yesterday. Just give her a couple of days and let her do her thing. ,,,,,,,,,
81,,,,That's it? She looks like she watched someone die.,,,,,,,,,
81,,,,"Hey, get up. You're just gonna sit here and mope around for the next week? ",,,,,,,,,
81,,,,*sniff* Yes… This is a good place to mope. ,,,,,,,,,
81,,,,"It was only one quiz, right? That doesn't make you nothing. Just figure out what you did wrong and do better next time.",,,,,,,,,
81,,,,"Hiroshi can help you study. Hiroshi, you gonna help her study, right?",,,,,,,,,
81,,,,"Huh? I mean, yeah, sure. If she's up for it. ",,,,,,,,,
81,,,,See? You're basically guaranteed to get a good grade on the next one. ,,,,,,,,,
81,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
81,,,,Okay! Let's study right now!,,,,,,,,,
81,,,,"Wait, right now?!",,,,,,,,,
81,,,,"Yeah! If I'm going to get better, I need to start studying for the next one ASAP! I'll go get my textbooks!",,,,,,,,,
81,,,,"…And she's gone. Seriously, Miku, be careful. You're lucky she didn't crash harder. ",,,,,,,,,
81,,,,And you need to tell her what she needs to hear. ,,,,,,,,,
81,,,,"…Okay, okay, I'll be careful next time. At least she pulled herself together.",,,,,,,,,
82,,,,You two were working together on music?! Without me?!,,,,,,,,,
82,,,,We weren't working *together.* We were literally just in the same room. Half of the time she was scrolling Twitter. ,,,,,,,,,
82,,,,That's totally together!! Miku never hangs out with me!,,,,,,,,,
82,,,,"Yeah, cuz you talk my head off. At least Hiroshi knows when to be quiet. ",,,,,,,,,
82,,,,"No fair. You probably told him to be quiet, and he was too nice to say no.",,,,,,,,,
82,,,,That's not what happened.,,,,,,,,,
82,,,,Oh. Still not fair!!!,,,,,,,,,
82,,,,"Ugh. If you wanted to join us, then you could've just asked, instead of making a big fuss of it.",,,,,,,,,
82,,,,"Wait, really? Yay ★ Can I join?",,,,,,,,,
82,,,,Too late. I'm exhausted. You two have fun.,,,,,,,,,
82,,,,Miku!!!!,,,,,,,,,
82,,,,Good job. You scared her off.,,,,,,,,,
83,,,,Mi~ku! Do you have any blank CDs? Yurina's gonna show me how to burn music.,,,,,,,,,
83,,,,Why are you asking me? Just get your own.,,,,,,,,,
83,,,,Seriously? Nothing in that giant storage room of yours? ,,,,,,,,,
83,,,,That room is off-limits. I'm still sorting everything into boxes. ,,,,,,,,,
83,,,,But *are* there any CDs? I don't mind have to clean up a little!,,,,,,,,,
83,,,,…You're better off just buying some. It's too much work for you two. ,,,,,,,,,
83,,,,"It's work that someone has to do anyway. If we help out a little, can we use your CDs?",,,,,,,,,
83,,,,…Fine. But you stop when I tell you. Don't be like Raika. ,,,,,,,,,
83,,,,Yay★ Cleaning up★,,,,,,,,,
83,,,,Only you would be excited to be cleaning...,,,,,,,,,
84,,,,"Yurina, why don't you try producing again? Hiroshi and I can help!",,,,,,,,,
84,,,,"Yeah, no, I'm really out of practice. It'll just sound bad. I'll stick to using others' music. ",,,,,,,,,
84,,,,"I bet it wasn't bad! If you were working with DIOS, you have to be good★",,,,,,,,,
84,,,,"I know, how about you show me your demos? Then I can judge for sure~",,,,,,,,,
84,,,,"Real subtle, Mayuko.",,,,,,,,,
84,,,,*Miku!!!*,,,,,,,,,
84,,,,"Yeah, nice try. I wouldn't be allowed to show you, anyway.",,,,,,,,,
84,,,,"Hmph. Thanks a lot, Miku. I almost had it.",,,,,,,,,
84,,,,You didn't have shit. Yurina's not stupid like that. ,,,,,,,,,
85,,,,Miku? Is that you up there?,,,,,,,,,
85,,,,Woah! I didn't know there was a walkway above the stage!,,,,,,,,,
85,,,,Mi~ku! Can you hear us?,,,,,,,,,
85,,,,"Ugh. Give me a second. And stay behind the tape, you'll get something dropped on you.",,,,,,,,,
85,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
85,,,,"Miku, I didn't know you could climb like that! Since when?",,,,,,,,,
85,,,,"What do you mean, since when? Did you forget this is *my* stage?",,,,,,,,,
85,,,,"Anyway, I was just fixing a floodlight. Not a big deal.",,,,,,,,,
85,,,,At least tie your hair back if you're going to be on the catwalk. It could snag on something while you're working. ,,,,,,,,,
85,,,,"Yeah yeah, I know that. You guys have fun.",,,,,,,,,
85,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
85,,,,"Absolutely not, Mayuko. ",,,,,,,,,
85,,,,Aww…,,,,,,,,,
86,,,,Wh— *Mayuko*!! I told you not to perform on stage until I gave you the all clear!,,,,,,,,,
86,,,,I did get the all clear though!!,,,,,,,,,
86,,,,"Yeah, from me. She's fine. ",,,,,,,,,
86,,,,"No, no, no! Mayuko, cut the music. We haven't done a proper inspection. Who knows how any of those cables were kept. ",,,,,,,,,
86,,,,Come *on.* Do you seriously think I'd let her hurt herself? ,,,,,,,,,
86,,,,"Yeah, Miku's not that mean. And we were having fun so far! ",,,,,,,,,
86,,,,I'll believe it when I see Miku actually take care of her venue. Music off. Clear the stage.,,,,,,,,,
86,,,,Aww…,,,,,,,,,
87,,,,"Woah, you have a whole collection going on here! I didn't know about any of these singles. ",,,,,,,,,
87,,,,"Yeah, makes sense. These were before they broke up, and they took all their music from that era off streaming.",,,,,,,,,
87,,,,"Some of these I got before they rebranded, but this one took forever to find online. I had to bid— um, way too much. ",,,,,,,,,
87,,,,"Hey, that's cool. You get bragging rights for being an original age of audio fan. ",,,,,,,,,
87,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
87,,,,"Hiroshi, can…",,,,,,,,,
87,,,,Can I borrow one of these?,,,,,,,,,
87,,,,"Uh… I mean, they took me a while to get. Why?",,,,,,,,,
87,,,,I want to see what's so good about them. ,,,,,,,,,
87,,,,"…I mean. If you're careful, and give it back in time…",,,,,,,,,
87,,,,Bet. Is this afternoon good?,,,,,,,,,
87,,,,"Oh, then that's okay. Knock yourself out.",,,,,,,,,
87,,,,Thanks. ,,,,,,,,,
87,,,,…Fuck. Should I have done that?,,,,,,,,,
87,,,,It's probably fine. It's not like Miku's gonna wreck your things on purpose. ,,,,,,,,,
88,,,,Hiroshi.,,,,,,,,,
88,,,,Hm? ,,,,,,,,,
88,,,,"Oh, my CD!",,,,,,,,,
88,,,,Thanks for bringing it back in one piece.,,,,,,,,,
88,,,,"See? Told you, Miku wouldn't smash your things.",,,,,,,,,
88,,,,The hell? What kind of animal do you guys take me for?,,,,,,,,,
88,,,,I just said that you *wouldn't* smash his CDs. I'm defending you. ,,,,,,,,,
88,,,,"Sorry… I was worried about this all afternoon. I mean, it's the only copy I have of age of audio's old music. ",,,,,,,,,
88,,,,…You don't like their new music?,,,,,,,,,
88,,,,"Well… Their new releases are cool, but there's something about their earlier work. It speaks to me more.",,,,,,,,,
88,,,,Or maybe I'm just nostalgic.,,,,,,,,,
88,,,,Nothing wrong with that. People change their style all the time.,,,,,,,,,
88,,,,"It's like, even if you try to replicate your old sound, you can't replicate the headspace you were in. ",,,,,,,,,
88,,,,It's why I don't produce anymore. No point in trying to force yourself to like it if you don't.,,,,,,,,,
88,,,,…Hm.,,,,,,,,,
88,,,,"Yeah, that's how I feel too.",,,,,,,,,
89,,,,Hmm… Anything?,,,,,,,,,
89,,,,"No, still nothing…",,,,,,,,,
89,,,,? What's going on here?,,,,,,,,,
89,,,,Trying to figure out why the speakers aren't getting any sound.,,,,,,,,,
89,,,,Can I see?,,,,,,,,,
89,,,,"No, it's okay, Miku and I can handle it…",,,,,,,,,
89,,,,"Go ahead, I'm sick of sitting here. I'm taking a break.",,,,,,,,,
89,,,,What— Miku! You can't just dump your work on others.,,,,,,,,,
89,,,,Solo's active on this channel. ,,,,,,,,,
89,,,,"Hm? Solo shouldn't affect the main mix, though.",,,,,,,,,
89,,,,"It says SIP. That shouldn't be on, right? I'm turning it off.",,,,,,,,,
89,,,,— ♪,,,,,,,,,
89,,,,"Oh. Ohhhhhh. Yeah, that's my bad.",,,,,,,,,
89,,,,…You cannot be serious. Why are you using this mixer for live sound?,,,,,,,,,
89,,,,"Hey, if it works, it works. At least we figured out what the issue was.",,,,,,,,,
90,,,,What the hell's going on here?? Are you two trying to torture me?,,,,,,,,,
90,,,,Sorry…,,,,,,,,,
90,,,,"No, don't be sorry. How else do you expect to learn to ring out the room?  ",,,,,,,,,
90,,,,More like he's ringing out my ears. I'm going mad in here from all the feedback.,,,,,,,,,
90,,,,"If Miku's bothered by it, shouldn't we just do this in VISR?",,,,,,,,,
90,,,,"I mean, it's not like she can leave SEKAI, so if she's really bothered…",,,,,,,,,
90,,,,…I see what you mean.,,,,,,,,,
90,,,,"*Thank you.* See, at least Hiroshi has a heart.",,,,,,,,,
90,,,,"Fine. But we'll have to find another day to do this, if that's okay with you.",,,,,,,,,
90,,,,"Yeah, that's fine. Thanks anyway.",,,,,,,,,
91,,,,"Hey, Miku, what are your thoughts on a sleepover?",,,,,,,,,
91,,,,"Yurina, don't bother Miku. This is a venue, not a hotel.",,,,,,,,,
91,,,,"You said the same thing about VISR, but you let me sleep over plenty. Besides, not like there's anyone else here.",,,,,,,,,
91,,,,And it was fun back then! Could be more fun without needing to be chased out the next morning.,,,,,,,,,
91,,,,"I don't know what you find so fun about sleeping on the couch, in a room without proper heating, instead of facing your problems. ",,,,,,,,,
91,,,,"And you, don't act all responsible. You're just as bad, indulging her like that.",,,,,,,,,
91,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
91,,,,"…So is that a no to the sleepover, or…",,,,,,,,,
91,,,,Hmph. Do what you want. It's your SEKAI now.,,,,,,,,,
91,,,,"What's her issue? Seriously, what a load of yap.",,,,,,,,,
91,,,,"Hey, Raika, don't look so down. Miku's just being sour. I mean, what does she know, anyway?",,,,,,,,,
91,,,,I guess…,,,,,,,,,
92,,,,"Hey Miku, I found this in one of the rooms. Is this yours?",,,,,,,,,
92,,,,! That guitar...,,,,,,,,,
92,,,,You can have it. ,,,,,,,,,
92,,,,"Really? Usually, you kick a fuss about anyone using your things.",,,,,,,,,
92,,,,"No one here plays it anymore. Just take it. Smash it on stage, or something.",,,,,,,,,
92,,,,No one's smashing anything on stage. ,,,,,,,,,
92,,,,"Fine, do whatever you want with it. Just don't expect me to play you anything. Bye.",,,,,,,,,
92,,,,[i]…—♪—[/i],,,,,,,,,
92,,,,"Blah, I'm no good at this. Hey Raika, you think Mayuko will teach me how to play guitar?",,,,,,,,,
92,,,,"You're already teaching her how to DJ. Just give that to me, I'll keep it safe.",,,,,,,,,
92,,,,"I mean, dunno what you're gonna do with a guitar, but sure. ",,,,,,,,,
92,,,,Just give that to me. ,,,,,,,,,
93,,,,"So they're cupids, but they kill people?",,,,,,,,,
93,,,,"Nonono, they just have guns instead of bows. Their goal is still to help people fall in love, but sometimes they get into gunfights with each other.",,,,,,,,,
93,,,,"…Still, it's really, really good. It's been on my cosplan list for a while. ",,,,,,,,,
93,,,,Hmm… They do look nice. I like the white-haired look.,,,,,,,,,
93,,,,"I'll check it out, then. Can I borrow your copy?",,,,,,,,,
93,,,,"!!! Yes, of course! I have the other volumes, too.",,,,,,,,,
93,,,,"For our weapons, I was thinking we could make them with EVA foam and PVC pipes, and then airbrush it so it looks smooth, so that…",,,,,,,,,
93,,,,"—Wait, hold on, we can't be walking around with fake weapons! We'll cause a panic!",,,,,,,,,
94,,,,…Where'd you get that?,,,,,,,,,
94,,,,This button pin? A girl in my class gave it to me. Do you know what this is supposed to be?,,,,,,,,,
94,,,,"""VISR""… no, I never heard of it. It looks, um, homemade.",,,,,,,,,
94,,,,That's putting it nicely. I think she got confused and thought we were trading. I just wanted to give her my business card.,,,,,,,,,
94,,,,"…Wait, why did you have business cards?",,,,,,,,,
94,,,,"What do you mean? For networking, obviously. If I want to survive in the real world, I'll need to make connections.",,,,,,,,,
94,,,,(I think you're both confused…) ,,,,,,,,,
95,,,,"Oh, look at that! Miku's on the big screen up there.",,,,,,,,,
95,,,,"It looks like she's having a concert soon. How does that work? No way it's like our Miku, right..?",,,,,,,,,
95,,,,"No, not like that. It's all prerecorded, and they use holograms to make it look like she's real. ",,,,,,,,,
95,,,,"Still, it's really fun. It's basically the same as a regular concert. I still have my lightsticks from a couple years ago.",,,,,,,,,
95,,,,"Hm… I've always wanted to go to a concert, but I don't think I should be buying tickets right now.",,,,,,,,,
95,,,,"Besides, we have our own Miku. I bet she'd love to give us a show. Maybe we should set up our own concert in SEKAI.",,,,,,,,,
95,,,,That's a fun idea… I'll let her know.,,,,,,,,,
96,,,,"Koharu, have you ever been here?",,,,,,,,,
96,,,,A sewing cafe? I haven't heard of this before…,,,,,,,,,
96,,,,"It's a really nice place. I came here once, but the sewing machines are too complicated for me... You might like it, though.",,,,,,,,,
96,,,,"I don't blame you, they're *seriously* difficult. It took me a long time just to learn how to load the bobbin.",,,,,,,,,
96,,,,"I know, how about we go together? I can teach you how to set it up, and we could get some work done.",,,,,,,,,
96,,,,…If you promise not to get annoyed.,,,,,,,,,
96,,,,"Of course I won't! We'll make a day of it, it'll be fun.",,,,,,,,,
97,,,,"Oh, you look perfect!! Exactly how I imagined!!!",,,,,,,,,
97,,,,"Again, thank you so much for doing this! I promise this won't take up too much time. After this, you'll be free.",,,,,,,,,
97,,,,"Really, it's fine… Actually, I should be thanking you. I've never been a model before. ",,,,,,,,,
97,,,,Of course! I hope you like the clothes.,,,,,,,,,
97,,,,"I've only ever modeled for myself and my little sister, so I really wanted to try designing for someone new. ",,,,,,,,,
97,,,,"Still, you did really well. It's cool you can make your own clothes.",,,,,,,,,
97,,,,"I mean, I can draw, but to have your designs in real life…",,,,,,,,,
97,,,,"I figured it can only help my portfolio. I can't make everything I design, though, so I have to pick my best.",,,,,,,,,
97,,,,"Alright! Photoshoot time. Follow me, I found a good spot.",,,,,,,,,
98,,,,"Honestly, I don't know how safe it is to store our cosplays here.",,,,,,,,,
98,,,,"It only takes MEIKO collapsing the wrong building, and all our work would be for nothing. ",,,,,,,,,
98,,,,"But SEKAI goes back to normal when Miku and MEIKO finish fighting, right? So they should be okay?",,,,,,,,,
98,,,,"Yes, but it still feels risky… and I don't want to wait for them just to grab our things.",,,,,,,,,
98,,,,"That's true… If we need to, I can probably save our outfits in my room. My parents won't mind.",,,,,,,,,
98,,,,Really? Don't you have your model kit collection?,,,,,,,,,
98,,,,I've been meaning to take them down to dust my shelves. I can rearrange my room while I'm at it and make space.,,,,,,,,,
98,,,,"*sigh* Thanks, Chiyomi. At least we won't have to worry about debris in our clothes.",,,,,,,,,
99,,,,"Do you really need to sprint the rest of the way here? You spend half of the commute on the bus, anyway.",,,,,,,,,
99,,,,"Of course I do! The bus is slow enough as is, I can't keep everyone waiting.",,,,,,,,,
99,,,,You'll just wear yourself out before we can even start the meeting. The five minutes you save isn't worth it.,,,,,,,,,
99,,,,"D'aww, Koharu, you're so considerate! But seriously, it's fine. It's actually pretty fun.",,,,,,,,,
99,,,,"I like to time myself and see how fast it takes me to make it. My best time is 4.49, but that was because it was a half day and there wasn't much crowd.",,,,,,,,,
99,,,,You sound like a racehorse. I don't understand how people just run for fun. ,,,,,,,,,
99,,,,"It's not that bad! A good jog is about as intensive as dancing is, anyway.",,,,,,,,,
99,,,,How about we go on a run together one day? I know some good routes on the way here!,,,,,,,,,
99,,,,"Eugh… sorry, not worth it.",,,,,,,,,
100,,,,"Honestly, the twist was awful. Not only did it come out of nowhere, but it wasn't even permanent??",,,,,,,,,
100,,,,"I mean, why not commit to it?! Why does she just get to walk it off?",,,,,,,,,
100,,,,"Yeah, that's fair. This director's known for some pretty dark stuff, so I think it's supposed to be a bait-and-switch.",,,,,,,,,
100,,,,"It's like, 'There's no way *this guy* is writing such a happy premise! There has to be some catch!'",,,,,,,,,
100,,,,"Hmph. I guess… I still feel kinda robbed, though. ",,,,,,,,,
100,,,,"I know, how about we watch some of his other shows in the meanwhile? Chiyomi really likes his work.",,,,,,,,,
100,,,,"Well, if you two think it's good. As long as it doesn't waste my time.",,,,,,,,,
101,,,,"Sanae, you seem distracted. Are you looking for someone?",,,,,,,,,
101,,,,"Hm? Oh, sorry Koharu. I thought my brother would be around here, but I don't see him anywhere…",,,,,,,,,
101,,,,There's another one?! I thought it was just you and your sisters.,,,,,,,,,
101,,,,"Yep! His name's Toshiki. Usually he's out here practicing violin. He's really serious about it, I think.",,,,,,,,,
101,,,,"Oh, so he's a street musician. I just assumed he was Yuuka's age.",,,,,,,,,
101,,,,"Nah, he's in your grade. He just kinda does his own thing, though. I mean, you know how teenage boys are.",,,,,,,,,
101,,,,"Hey, if we see him, I'll introduce you! You two would totally get along!",,,,,,,,,
101,,,,"I mean, if he's okay with it… I don't want to impose on his practice.",,,,,,,,,
101,,,,(He's a violinist? That's really impressive. I wonder what he's like…),,,,,,,,,
102,,,,(Oh! Sanae is there. Looks like she went shopping—),,,,,,,,,
102,,,,(IS SHE BLEEDING?????? BLEEDING FROM THE MOUTH??????),,,,,,,,,
102,,,,SANAE??? ,,,,,,,,,
102,,,,"Huh? Oh! Hi Koharu, nice seeing you here!",,,,,,,,,
102,,,,What the hell happened to you??? Why are you bleeding??,,,,,,,,,
102,,,,"Haha, about that… I was in a rush to buy groceries, and I tripped on the pavement.",,,,,,,,,
102,,,,"But there was a sale on vegatables, so it was worth it.",,,,,,,,,
102,,,,"Are you insane? Do you think you're being cute, walking around with a split lip? Come with me, I'll ask one of the stores if they have bandages.",,,,,,,,,
102,,,,You really don't have to—,,,,,,,,,
102,,,,Don't even start with that. Come on.,,,,,,,,,
103,,,,"It was nice running into you, Koharu! Hope I didn't pull you away from anything important.",,,,,,,,,
103,,,,"No, it's not like that. I had to come out here to pick up a package. I thought I'd pay utilities while I'm at it, too.",,,,,,,,,
103,,,,Pay utilities..?! Don't you live with your aunts? ,,,,,,,,,
103,,,,Yes? I can't just live with them for free. Everyone has to pull their weight.,,,,,,,,,
103,,,,That's just like you…,,,,,,,,,
103,,,,"But even so, can't you just give them your share directly? Why go through all the hassle of coming out here?",,,,,,,,,
103,,,,"…Honestly, it just feels more proper. Like I'm an actual tenant. ",,,,,,,,,
103,,,,"When we're adults, we'll have to do something like this, right? I might as well get used to it now.",,,,,,,,,
103,,,,"That's… well, it's a little weird. I don't think anyone looks forward to paying utilities. ",,,,,,,,,
103,,,,"If it were me, I'd pay them directly just to avoid the convinence store fee.",,,,,,,,,
103,,,,"Ugh, I know… It's fine. That's just life.",,,,,,,,,
103,,,,"(She's younger than me, and already acting like an adult… It kinda gets me down.)",,,,,,,,,
104,,,,"Sanae, when you plan choreo, is there a methodology to it? Or do you just do whatever feels right?",,,,,,,,,
104,,,,"Umm… a bit of both, I guess? Sometimes, I'll have a really clear idea for a certain part, and then it's just figuring out how to get there.",,,,,,,,,
104,,,,"But honestly, I just study others. I think most of my ideas are osmosised, anyway. ",,,,,,,,,
104,,,,"Like, you know at the end of Lovcure episodes, when they do that dance sequence?",,,,,,,,,
104,,,,I skip those. ,,,,,,,,,
104,,,,For real?! Akari and Yuuka love them. I think they practice it in their own time.,,,,,,,,,
104,,,,"Of course they would, they're the target audience. It's not like it's relevant to the plot. ",,,,,,,,,
104,,,,"Well, don't tell the others, but I stole some moves from there. Sue me.",,,,,,,,,
104,,,,"Right… well, as long as you're having fun.",,,,,,,,,
105,,,,"Hey, Koharu! Wanna eat lunch together? I got us some chips from the school store.",,,,,,,,,
105,,,,"So quickly?! Lunch just started, isn't the line really long?",,,,,,,,,
105,,,,"Um, are you forgetting who you're talking to? All I had to do was ask, and everyone graciously stepped aside for me. ",,,,,,,,,
105,,,,"Perks of being the most popular girl in school. You're welcome, by the way. ",,,,,,,,,
105,,,,"You got out of class early. You know, you're only supposed to leave class if you have an actual reason for it. ",,,,,,,,,
105,,,,"Blah, I have to leave after lunch, anyway. Can't you just play along? I still got you something.",,,,,,,,,
105,,,,I'd appreciate it more if you didn't make up an entire fantasy to go along with it.,,,,,,,,,
105,,,,"But sure, we can eat together. Thanks for the snack.",,,,,,,,,
106,,,,"Wow, aren't we smart? We got the same answers on these problems.",,,,,,,,,
106,,,,"Looks like I had nothing to worry about. Thanks for checking anyway, Koharu~ ",,,,,,,,,
106,,,,"…Kaori, how long did you work on this for?",,,,,,,,,
106,,,,"Huh? Like, an hour or something. Like I said, it was easy work. Why?",,,,,,,,,
106,,,,Because I was waiting for you to call me out on using the wrong formula. All of these are wrong.,,,,,,,,,
106,,,,?!,,,,,,,,,
106,,,,Seriously?! All of them-?!,,,,,,,,,
106,,,,"Hey, so you were giving me the wrong answers? Not cool, Koharu.",,,,,,,,,
106,,,,You're telling me! You'd realize this if you had studied!,,,,,,,,,
106,,,,"What was the plan, anyway? It's not like you would've understood the concept just by looking at my answers.",,,,,,,,,
106,,,,I was going to work backwards…,,,,,,,,,
106,,,,"Ugh. Fine, I'll explain one of them. But the rest, you're redoing on your own.",,,,,,,,,
106,,,,Sigh…,,,,,,,,,
107,,,,"Kaori, have you heard of this anime?",,,,,,,,,
107,,,,"Oh, I've seen this one around online. I didn't realize they did billboards, too.",,,,,,,,,
107,,,,"Makes sense, though. It's an idol mobage, so they definitely have the money. They got some big names in this project.",,,,,,,,,
107,,,,"Oh, so it's not an anime. That's a shame, the animations looked interesting.",,,,,,,,,
107,,,,"Hey, why not give it a shot? Just cause it's a gacha doesn't mean it can't have a good story.",,,,,,,,,
107,,,,"Actually, I've been in a few titles myself. It was pretty fun, I got to work with a lot of interesting people~",,,,,,,,,
107,,,,"Wait, really?",,,,,,,,,
107,,,,"…No, you're just messing with me again. Besides, I'm not going to start gambling just to support you. ",,,,,,,,,
107,,,,Sigh… Caught once more.,,,,,,,,,
108,,,,Huh. I've never had boba before. I wonder if the black tea here's any good.,,,,,,,,,
108,,,,"Seriously? Like, ever? Were there no boba spots in your old town?",,,,,,,,,
108,,,,"Not really. There was probably some in the city, but I never bothered to go and try it.",,,,,,,,,
108,,,,"Damn. You gotta keep up, Koharu. Imagine if you were in the industry and they found out you never had boba. They'd laugh you out of the interview.",,,,,,,,,
108,,,,They're not going to ask me about my boba preferences in an interview. Be real.,,,,,,,,,
108,,,,"I'm being so real. If you want to be a fashion designer, you need to keep up with the trends, or you'll get torn apart.",,,,,,,,,
108,,,,"Ripped to shreds by the masses, fed to the sharks, forced to work retail forever…",,,,,,,,,
108,,,,"Ok I get it, I'm uncultured. Are you going to order?",,,,,,,,,
109,,,,"Hey, that wasn't so bad. You remembered the second part, at least.",,,,,,,,,
109,,,,Ugh… I can't follow all these steps. How do you get this down so quickly? ,,,,,,,,,
109,,,,"Please, this is light work for me. When I was an idol, they used to give me half an hour to learn a routine. If I didn't get it down by then, then I didn't get lunch.",,,,,,,,,
109,,,,"...That's concerning, actually. Aren't there laws against that?",,,,,,,,,
109,,,,"Yeah, but you see, my producer was involved with a shadow government—",,,,,,,,,
109,,,,"Oh my god. Nevermind, you're actually full of shit.",,,,,,,,,
110,,,,"Ha… Sorry I bailed on you there, Koharu. ",,,,,,,,,
110,,,,"No worries. It's nothing to be sorry about, those girls wanted your autograph, not mine. ",,,,,,,,,
110,,,,"Yeah, I mean, obviously. Of course, anyone would be honored to see the brilliant Kaori Umetsu on her off-time~",,,,,,,,,
110,,,,"You know, you should consider yourself blessed. There are people out there who would die to know me.",,,,,,,,,
110,,,,…Are you okay? You look stressed out.,,,,,,,,,
110,,,,"Uh, why wouldn't I be? It was barely five minutes. It's nothing. ",,,,,,,,,
110,,,,—?! What are you doing??,,,,,,,,,
110,,,,Fixing your glasses. We don't need more people recognizing you while you're off the clock.,,,,,,,,,
110,,,,"You know, we can still go to SEKAI, if you want. At least there you can have some peace of mind. ",,,,,,,,,
110,,,,"Nah, it's fine. Really.",,,,,,,,,
110,,,,"Besides, we already came all the way here, might as well enjoy the fresh air!",,,,,,,,,
110,,,,…If you say so.,,,,,,,,,
111,,,,Ugh… I wish MEIKO would get a grip. It's not like we're leaving anytime soon. ,,,,,,,,,
111,,,,"Honestly, I wonder what she's trying to do. ",,,,,,,,,
111,,,,"I mean, if her goal is to destroy SEKAI, wouldn't it make more sense for her to target us? Fighting Miku seems like a waste of time.",,,,,,,,,
111,,,,"Don't give her ideas… If I come here and get kidnapped, I'll give her a piece of my mind.",,,,,,,,,
111,,,,"I don't think you can give her much else. No offense, but you're seriously lacking in the strength department.",,,,,,,,,
111,,,,"No offense,' she says…",,,,,,,,,
112,,,,"I wonder if we should do something for the cultural festival. They allow other students to visit, so I'd be able to blend in perfectly.",,,,,,,,,
112,,,,"They'll only allow others in on the second day, so probably not...",,,,,,,,,
112,,,,...Maybe I could get away with it?,,,,,,,,,
112,,,,"Ahaha, nevermind. I don't want to stress you out or anything. I'll probably be busy with the Kamiyama cultural festival, anyway... ",,,,,,,,,
112,,,,But don't hold me to that! I'll find a way. Probably. ,,,,,,,,,
112,,,,"Ok, if you're sure…",,,,,,,,,
113,,,,"Ahh, sorry Chiyomi, I can't hang out for too long. I need to get back to school.",,,,,,,,,
113,,,,Really? So late in the day..?,,,,,,,,,
113,,,,"I'm supposed to help the basketball club today, 'cause their coach is sick. I just hope it doesn't run on for too long.",,,,,,,,,
113,,,,"Oh, that must be fun. I remember you used to play in middle school... ",,,,,,,,,
113,,,,"...Wait, do you not play anymore?",,,,,,,,,
113,,,,"Ahaha, I'm just too busy. I haven't played in a while, I'd be totally out of practice if I tried to start now.",,,,,,,,,
113,,,,"Oh... I see. Have fun, then.",,,,,,,,,
114,,,,"Oh my god, look at the time!! We didn't get anything done!!",,,,,,,,,
114,,,,"Seriously, how'd you end up dragging me out here? This was supposed to be a brainstorming session!!!",,,,,,,,,
114,,,,Sorry... It slipped my mind...,,,,,,,,,
114,,,,"Yeah, right, you brought me here on purpose.",,,,,,,,,
114,,,,See!! You're literally smiling!! ,,,,,,,,,
114,,,,Don't know what you're talking about…,,,,,,,,,
114,,,,Chiyomi!!! ,,,,,,,,,
114,,,,"At least the food was good. We should come here again. It's not that far from yours, too.",,,,,,,,,
114,,,,"Yeah, true, but maybe when I don't need to pick up the girls like, right now. Sorry, Chiyomi.",,,,,,,,,
115,,,,Fabric is so expensive...,,,,,,,,,
115,,,,"Yeah, no kidding. I wonder if this is the type Koharu uses. I mean, it *feels* similar...",,,,,,,,,
115,,,,I think it is. She mentioned coming around here to buy her fabric before.,,,,,,,,,
115,,,,...She's gonna be so surprised.,,,,,,,,,
115,,,,"Man, I wish I could help you. Even if it's just the skirt, actually sewing it sounds difficult.",,,,,,,,,
115,,,,"No, you've helped me enough by coming along. I know you're busy, so... ",,,,,,,,,
115,,,,Don't say that! I'm never too busy for you. ,,,,,,,,,
116,,,,"Ugh, I can't believe her... Sorry about Yuuka, Chiyomi. I did not teach her to act like this.",,,,,,,,,
116,,,,"No, it's alright. Did something happen..? Last time I visited, she seemed to like me...",,,,,,,,,
116,,,,It's nothing you did. She's just been like this lately. Maybe it's growing pains.,,,,,,,,,
116,,,,...Are you should it's nothing serious?,,,,,,,,,
116,,,,"I've asked her teachers, and she's seems to be fine there... I mean, maybe there's something she's not telling me, but...",,,,,,,,,
116,,,,"Ah, nevermind. I shouldn't bother you with my problems. At least Akari was happy to see you again!",,,,,,,,,
116,,,,I guess... ,,,,,,,,,
117,,,,*distant explosions*,,,,,,,,,
117,,,,Ugh… they're fighting again…,,,,,,,,,
117,,,,"I mean, they seem far away… I think we can still eat lunch over here.",,,,,,,,,
117,,,,"I dunno, MEIKO might spot us. I don't feel like getting roped into one of her monologues.",,,,,,,,,
117,,,,"Hey, what if I tried sneaking over to Miya's? I don't have any council meetings today, so no one'll realize I'm gone!",,,,,,,,,
117,,,,"I don't think you'll make it back in time, so…",,,,,,,,,
117,,,,"Yeah, I thought as much… I just hope they finish up before school gets out. ",,,,,,,,,
118,,,,"Chiyomi, you're doing ok, right?",,,,,,,,,
118,,,,"Like, classes aren't getting you down? No one's causing you trouble?",,,,,,,,,
118,,,,"Yeah, I'm fine…",,,,,,,,,
118,,,,You're sure?,,,,,,,,,
118,,,,"Sanae, seriously. ",,,,,,,,,
118,,,,"Ahaha, just making sure. I always have the time for you, you know?",,,,,,,,,
118,,,,"Yeah, I know… Thanks, Sanae.",,,,,,,,,
118,,,,Of course!!,,,,,,,,,
118,,,,(…),,,,,,,,,
118,,,,(I wish she wouldn't do that…),,,,,,,,,
119,,,,Chiyomi? Whatcha doing hiding over here?,,,,,,,,,
119,,,,O-Oh… ,,,,,,,,,
119,,,,A Switch? Is that allowed?,,,,,,,,,
119,,,,Probably not. But it's better than scrolling Tricktrick for all of lunch.,,,,,,,,,
119,,,,"…Yeah, that's fair. That's what I do most of the time.",,,,,,,,,
119,,,,This looks way better though! Can I join?,,,,,,,,,
119,,,,"! Yeah, of course! I'll load a game we can play together.",,,,,,,,,
119,,,,"This one? I'll warn you, I'm basically a pro. I've never been beaten at a racing game, it's like, in my genes.",,,,,,,,,
119,,,,"We'll see. You forgot to press ready, by the way.",,,,,,,,,
119,,,,Oh shit. That was on purpose.      Trust.,,,,,,,,,
120,,,,"Hey, I hope you don't mind if I ask, but why are you in the credit system?",,,,,,,,,
120,,,,"I mean, I know you leave after second period, but you never talk about it.",,,,,,,,,
120,,,,…I have supplementary classes for math. It's an accomodation. ,,,,,,,,,
120,,,,"They said it would be easier to switch to the credit system than try to fit into the normal class schedule, so…",,,,,,,,,
120,,,,"Ohhh, I get it. Honestly, I dunno why people think it's for idols only. The credit system's way better in general.",,,,,,,,,
120,,,,"More people should be in the credit system, just because they can. ",,,,,,,,,
120,,,,…That would be nice. ,,,,,,,,,
120,,,,(At least then it might not feel as intimidating…),,,,,,,,,
121,,,,"Hey, Chiyomi, look at this.",,,,,,,,,
121,,,,Oh! Can badges of the new Lovcure. Do they have Mitsuki?,,,,,,,,,
121,,,,…Doesn't look like it. They have Count Null though. I'm gonna give it a try.,,,,,,,,,
121,,,,"I don't get why they leave her out. She's just as important as the main duo. It's obvious she's going to be a late season Cure, anyway…",,,,,,,,,
121,,,,"Um, Kaori, should we go now..?",,,,,,,,,
121,,,,"No, wait, one more. I'll get her on the next one, I feel it.",,,,,,,,,
121,,,,(Oh no… She's been trapped…),,,,,,,,,
122,,,,That was fun. I think we got some progress done.,,,,,,,,,
122,,,,"…But seriously, girl, you have to relax. No one's watching us all the way out here.",,,,,,,,,
122,,,,I don't know how you're so nonchalant… You're literally a public figure. Shouldn't you be worried someone's gonna see you?,,,,,,,,,
122,,,,"Wow, what a scandal. 'Umetsu's daughter caught practicing a dance routine in the middle of the park.' *That's* sure to make the headlines.",,,,,,,,,
122,,,,Mm… But still…,,,,,,,,,
122,,,,"Don't worry about me. I've got the press in the palm of my hand. If something happens, I'll handle it.",,,,,,,,,
122,,,,Now come on! One more go!,,,,,,,,,
123,,,,You got the binoculars? ,,,,,,,,,
123,,,,"Yep. They're kinda old though, they're my dad's old birding binoculars.",,,,,,,,,
123,,,,"That's fine, as long as they work. I got the snacks and eye protection.",,,,,,,,,
123,,,,I don't think that counts as eye protection.,,,,,,,,,
123,,,,We'll be fine~ As if we're even gonna need it. We'll just stay away from any collapsing buildings. ,,,,,,,,,
123,,,,Alright! Operation 'Stormchasing a magical girl battle' is a go! Let's find Miku and MEIKO!,,,,,,,,,
124,,,,"Oh, Chiyomi, you're having lunch over here? Nice.",,,,,,,,,
124,,,,"Actually, I wanted to ask if I missed anything important. I just got back, and there was some buzz about a quiz…",,,,,,,,,
124,,,,Oh. I'm skipping class today…,,,,,,,,,
124,,,,Seriously? You got a fever or something? ,,,,,,,,,
124,,,,…Sure.,,,,,,,,,
124,,,,"Hey, more power to you. I'll go back out and see if one of our classmates can share notes.",,,,,,,,,
124,,,,"I'll pass it along to you, too. Let's study together later!",,,,,,,,,
125,,,,"Hey, that actually worked really well! The soft tennis club just let me walk in like it was nothing.",,,,,,,,,
125,,,,"Told you they don't care. Maybe don't do it too often, though. They might think something's up.",,,,,,,,,
125,,,,"Yeah, I thought so. Still, how'd you even find that out? ",,,,,,,,,
125,,,,Simple. It's the Umetsu name. I've got connections in places you could never imagine.,,,,,,,,,
125,,,,"So long as they know you're with me, they won't lift a finger. You're welcome.",,,,,,,,,
125,,,,"Damn. So Miya's cutthroat like that. Glad I'm on your side, then.",,,,,,,,,
125,,,,Hehe.,,,,,,,,,
126,,,,!?,,,,,,,,,
126,,,,?!,,,,,,,,,
126,,,,…We're both not supposed to be here.,,,,,,,,,
126,,,,Speak for yourself. I had a meeting with my manager. Did Kamiyama get out early today?,,,,,,,,,
126,,,,"Ahaha… I might be skipping… I don't have any meetings afterschool today, so it's not that big of a deal.",,,,,,,,,
126,,,,Hell yeah. As long as you don't get caught. Let's get to Miya's early and surprise the others.,,,,,,,,,
127,,,,"Hey, Kaori, you do acting. Have you heard about this?",,,,,,,,,
127,,,,Wonderland x Showtime is visiting Pheonix Stage… The theatre troupe? I thought they disbanded. ,,,,,,,,,
127,,,,"They're putting on a reunion show, and this is supposed to be the last stop. I'm definitely going to be there!",,,,,,,,,
127,,,,"I don't know too much about live theatre, but that's good for you. Didn't know you were into theatre like that. ",,,,,,,,,
127,,,,"Honestly, not really, I just like these guys.",,,,,,,,,
127,,,,"I've only ever been able to see their livestreams, but I think it's okay to spurge just this once! I'll take the girls and make it a trip.",,,,,,,,,
127,,,,"Have fun~ While you're there, you should try the rides too. The haunted house one's my favorite.",,,,,,,,,
128,,,,"Isn't it a pain having to wear a disguise everytime you want to go outside? Like, even for a quick run?",,,,,,,,,
128,,,,"Nah, not really. It's not like it takes long for me to put on.",,,,,,,,,
128,,,,"And besides, it saves me time. If I went out without all this, the people would be all over me~ Love them, but even I need a break from the cameras.",,,,,,,,,
128,,,,"Oh, I get it. Seeing you like this, I'd never imagine that you'd be an idol. You look so regular.",,,,,,,,,
128,,,,…Hehe. Looks can be deceiving. ,,,,,,,,,
129,,,,It's impressive how easily you're able to get out of class. I'm only able to get away with it because I'm in the credit system.,,,,,,,,,
129,,,,"Yeah, I feel bad sometimes… But it's not like I'm a bad student or anything! Just a bad hall monitor.",,,,,,,,,
129,,,,"Oh, I see. Doesn't the committee get on your case? Miya's is pretty strict about these things.",,,,,,,,,
129,,,,"Honestly, they're mostly chill. As long as people aren't blowing up the school, I can get away with not writing people up.",,,,,,,,,
129,,,,"Like, literally. Apparently, it was really bad some years ago.",,,,,,,,,
129,,,,Huh... Maybe we should move the club location to Kamiyama.,,,,,,,,,
130,,,,This is so embarrassing… you should've woken me up.,,,,,,,,,
130,,,,"I tried, but you were out like a light. I didn't want to disturb you.",,,,,,,,,
130,,,,"Gh… and we were supposed to plan the next part of the song, too…",,,,,,,,,
130,,,,"Kaori, is it okay if we met up tomorrow? I need to head out soon.",,,,,,,,,
130,,,,"Yeah, I don't mind. Life happens.",,,,,,,,,
130,,,,"Oh, but you should probably check your face before you leave. You might have something on there~",,,,,,,,,
130,,,,—! Kaori! Is that why you have that marker?!,,,,,,,,,
130,,,,"Hehe. Maybe, maybe not. Ciao.",,,,,,,,,
131,,,,Koharu~~★ Welcome back~~★,,,,,,,,,
131,,,,"Ah! You don't look so good. Actually, you look really, really tired! ",,,,,,,,,
131,,,,…Thank you for noticing.,,,,,,,,,
131,,,,"That won't do! Come on, let's go to the stage, I'll show you the dance I've been working on! It'll cheer you right up—",,,,,,,,,
131,,,,AHHH!!! She collapsed!! ,,,,,,,,,
131,,,,"Miku, please calm down. I just wanted to lie down. ",,,,,,,,,
131,,,,"…Look, Miku. I'm sure your dance is nice, but I just got off my shift. I'm not up for it right now…",,,,,,,,,
131,,,,"Oh, okay! As long as you're okay~",,,,,,,,,
131,,,,"Thanks, Miku. But, um, you don't need to lie down with me…",,,,,,,,,
131,,,,Nope! Not letting you be on the floor alone.,,,,,,,,,
131,,,,"After all, even magical girls need their 'lie down and stare at the sky' time!",,,,,,,,,
131,,,,"…Actually, sure. Lie down and stare at the sky time is great.",,,,,,,,,
132,,,,"Koharu, I've always wondered, but where do you work?",,,,,,,,,
132,,,,"I'm a server for a cafe… It's usually really busy, but it pays, at least. ",,,,,,,,,
132,,,,"Ooh, that's so fun!! You get to serve others! I bet you get to meet a lot of people~★ Any regulars you like?",,,,,,,,,
132,,,,…I think you have the wrong idea. It's not like I get to know the customers personally. ,,,,,,,,,
132,,,,No? Not even a favorite?,,,,,,,,,
132,,,,My favorites are the ones who don't spill their drink all over the floor for me to clean up.,,,,,,,,,
132,,,,Boo… That's no fun at all…,,,,,,,,,
133,,,,"This one's my favorite. It took me a while to get, and I still haven't added all the decals, but—",,,,,,,,,
133,,,,WOW!!! It's so detailed!! And you built it all by yourself?!,,,,,,,,,
133,,,,It's not that impressive… Just some assembly…,,,,,,,,,
133,,,,Still!!! That's super-duper cool! ,,,,,,,,,
133,,,,"Oh, I wish I could have something like that. If I had a giant robot body, I'd be able to defeat MEIKO no problem…",,,,,,,,,
133,,,,I know what you mean. To have that kind of strength… ,,,,,,,,,
133,,,,"Wait, but you already have powers. Would a robot body really help that much?",,,,,,,,,
133,,,,Oh yeah. Teehee★,,,,,,,,,
134,,,,"What grand looking buildings… That's the academy, right? It looks more like a castle. ",,,,,,,,,
134,,,,"Yep! It's super pretty on the inside, too!",,,,,,,,,
134,,,,But I like it out here the most. I get lots of space to practice.,,,,,,,,,
134,,,,"Mhm, I see what you mean.",,,,,,,,,
134,,,,"But, um, I was just wondering. Doesn't that mean you're supposed to be in class..?",,,,,,,,,
134,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
134,,,,Maybe…,,,,,,,,,
134,,,,"But *pleaseeeeeeee*, pretty please don't tell the others!!! Koharu will totally tell me off for skipping!!!",,,,,,,,,
134,,,,"And if I have to sit in a boring classroom all day, my brains will melt! Then how will I defend the school from MEIKO? ",,,,,,,,,
134,,,,…That's a good point. It'll be bad if you can't defend SEKAI.,,,,,,,,,
134,,,,"Wait, really?",,,,,,,,,
134,,,,"—I mean, yeah! I knew you'd get it, Chiyomi★ Hehe.",,,,,,,,,
135,,,,"Tada! So whatcha think, Miku? It's just a tiny part of the whole song, but I think it's good for us to start with.",,,,,,,,,
135,,,,SO FUN!!! I can't believe you came up with that in a day!!,,,,,,,,,
135,,,,"Wait, do it again, do it again! I wanna try copying you!",,,,,,,,,
135,,,,"Ahaha, sorry Miku. I just stopped by to ask your opinion… I'm going to be heading back out soon.",,,,,,,,,
135,,,,Aww…,,,,,,,,,
135,,,,Ok! But come again when you can★,,,,,,,,,
136,,,,Hmhmhm~ Ladedadeda~,,,,,,,,,
136,,,,Watching me do my homework can't be that exciting. Do you even know what this is on?,,,,,,,,,
136,,,,Nope! Not a clue★,,,,,,,,,
136,,,,"I just wanted to keep you company. Um, since you don't usually visit SEKAI on your own.",,,,,,,,,
136,,,,"Wait, really? I feel like I've come by plenty of times.",,,,,,,,,
136,,,,"Yeah, but it's always with Chiyomi or the rest of the club. Never by yourself.",,,,,,,,,
136,,,,"So I thought, someone should be with you so you don't get lonely!",,,,,,,,,
136,,,,"D'aww, you're too sweet, Miku.",,,,,,,,,
136,,,,(Hehe. She's just like Akari…),,,,,,,,,
137,,,,Grrr!!! I can't stand that annoying MEIKO!!! Who does she think she is!!,,,,,,,,,
137,,,,Showing up and trying to destroy the academy like that!!! And interrupting my practice!! Hmph!,,,,,,,,,
137,,,,"Hmm... Miku, is she also a student here?",,,,,,,,,
137,,,,Umm… maybe? She seems like the upperclassman-type.,,,,,,,,,
137,,,,"In that case, I think I have an idea.",,,,,,,,,
137,,,,"You find out who she is when she's untransformed. Follow her, get a sense of her schedule… ",,,,,,,,,
137,,,,"Then, when you're sure she's alone, you take her out! Get the jump on her before she can transform! You can even make it look like an accident. ",,,,,,,,,
137,,,,...EH?!?!,,,,,,,,,
137,,,,"Yeah, I know, I'm genius. You're welcome~",,,,,,,,,
137,,,,NO!! No no no!! I'm *not* committing civilian murder!!,,,,,,,,,
137,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
137,,,,But she's not a—,,,,,,,,,
137,,,,No no no no no!! Not listening!! That kind of underhanded violence… It's just playing dirty!,,,,,,,,,
137,,,,"I'm not seeing how your battles are any different... but okay, your loss.",,,,,,,,,
138,,,,Kaori!!! Wait up!!! ,,,,,,,,,
138,,,,"Hm? Oh, Miku! Do you want something?",,,,,,,,,
138,,,,"You're going to the outskirts, right? I'll come with you!  ",,,,,,,,,
138,,,,Hm? But don't you want to practice your routine? I'm just going to explore for a bit.,,,,,,,,,
138,,,,"Yeah, but it's dangerous to go alone! MEIKO could show up at any moment! ",,,,,,,,,
138,,,,"Pfft, MEIKO doesn't bother me. The worst she can do is monologue at me. All bark and no bite. ",,,,,,,,,
138,,,,Huh? ,,,,,,,,,
138,,,,"Honestly, I don't blame her. She's probably coming to terms with the fact that she'll never match my brillance. It's a tough pill to swallow for many.",,,,,,,,,
138,,,,"Anyway, you don't need to worry about us. See ya.",,,,,,,,,
138,,,,…? Us?,,,,,,,,,
139,,,,"Wait, you two are still studying?!",,,,,,,,,
139,,,,"Wow, you two must be model students. I could never★ Teehee.",,,,,,,,,
139,,,,?,,,,,,,,,
139,,,,"What on earth do you mean, 'still studying'? We only started fifteen minutes ago.",,,,,,,,,
139,,,,What? Really? It feels like it's been forever… ,,,,,,,,,
139,,,,"How about we take a break! It's boring sitting here all the time. We can go on a walk, or go to the garden, or…",,,,,,,,,
139,,,,"Absolutely not. You need to have some discipline, Miku. We can't drop everything just because you're bored.",,,,,,,,,
139,,,,Boo…,,,,,,,,,
139,,,,"…If you'd like, you can sit here with us. I'll give you some of my books.",,,,,,,,,
139,,,,"It's not as exciting, but it'll be nice if we can all hang out together… if you want.",,,,,,,,,
139,,,,"Oh, that's fine too! Books are also fun.",,,,,,,,,
140,,,,"Miku, I was thinking… We've only ever seen you transformed. Are you ever untransformed, or are you stuck like that..?",,,,,,,,,
140,,,,"What? Of course I'm not stuck like this! If I showed up to class in this, everyone would totally have questions! ",,,,,,,,,
140,,,,"I still don't get that, considering you don't seem to learn anything… ",,,,,,,,,
140,,,,But I guess I can understand that. Maybe we'll get to see you untransformed one day.,,,,,,,,,
140,,,,Nope★,,,,,,,,,
140,,,,Really?,,,,,,,,,
140,,,,"Hehe, sorry. But it would be totally bad if you guys knew who I really am! It's a liability! ",,,,,,,,,
140,,,,"I guess that's how it is in shows, too…",,,,,,,,,
140,,,,Why does the TV show logic have to apply to *us*?,,,,,,,,,
141,,,,"Thanks for meeting up so quickly, Sanae… I really should've done this beforehand.",,,,,,,,,
141,,,,"Hey, don't sweat about it! This won't take that long, right?",,,,,,,,,
141,,,,"No, no, just a couple more minutes. Can you raise your arms?",,,,,,,,,
141,,,,Got it!,,,,,,,,,
141,,,,"Oooh, oooh, me next!!! I wanna get measured!",,,,,,,,,
141,,,,Miku? What do you need measurements for? Is your dress not fitting you?,,,,,,,,,
141,,,,"No, my dress always fits me perfectly. It's magic★",,,,,,,,,
141,,,,"But I've never had to get measured before, so I was curious… I want to know the numbers! ",,,,,,,,,
141,,,,"Okay, I can measure you afterwards. But you'll need to find something less frilly to wear. It'll be a pain working around all those layers.",,,,,,,,,
141,,,,Um…,,,,,,,,,
141,,,,"Miku, if you want, I could bring over some of my old clothes. Those will probably fit you!",,,,,,,,,
141,,,,Really?! Okay!! ,,,,,,,,,
142,,,,"Koharu, you sure there's nothing I can help you with? I mean, working on all those clothes can't be easy…",,,,,,,,,
142,,,,It's fine. It's not like I'm making them from scratch. I'm mostly making modifications.,,,,,,,,,
142,,,,"Chiyomi's been a great help, too. She's picking up on the basics really quickly. ",,,,,,,,,
142,,,,"Really? Maybe I should learn how to sew too, I could help lighten the load.",,,,,,,,,
142,,,,Oh! Me too! I want to help! ,,,,,,,,,
142,,,,"Sanae, seriously, it's fine. You're already doing choreography. It's more trouble when everyone tries to work on everything all at once.",,,,,,,,,
142,,,,And Miku… you have enough on your plate with MEIKO.,,,,,,,,,
142,,,,Pleaseeeee? At some point? Just for fun?,,,,,,,,,
142,,,,...Sure. When I find the time.,,,,,,,,,
143,,,,Where on earth did you get all these keychains?!,,,,,,,,,
143,,,,"Gachapon. Here, take your pick, there's plenty of choices.",,,,,,,,,
143,,,,"Did you clear our the entire machine or something?! Seriously, don't waste your money.",,,,,,,,,
143,,,,"So cruel, Koharu. I did this out of the kindness of my heart. Now all of us can have any keychain we want.",,,,,,,,,
143,,,,"Oooh, this bear mascot is so cute!! Can I have this one? ",,,,,,,,,
143,,,,"Go ahead, Miku. Actually, you can take them all.",,,,,,,,,
143,,,,What's anyone going to do with 10 of the same keychain?,,,,,,,,,
143,,,,"It's good to have backups, just in case the chain breaks. Or she can start a shrine.",,,,,,,,,
143,,,,I know! I can wear all of them on my staff at the same time!,,,,,,,,,
143,,,,"If MEIKO tries to mess with the SEKAI, I'll swing this at her and knock her out like a club!",,,,,,,,,
143,,,,I doubt that'll do any more damage than attacking her normally…,,,,,,,,,
144,,,,"I don't get you at all, Koharu. How is dancing okay, but an hour of gym isn't?",,,,,,,,,
144,,,,Those two can't be further apart from each other.,,,,,,,,,
144,,,,A dance routine is a performance. You're trying to send a message to the crowd. There's a level of control in that.,,,,,,,,,
144,,,,Running around and getting all sweaty and tired… it's just undignified. ,,,,,,,,,
144,,,,"So it's about how you look… I mean, it's only gym. Everyone's miserable in gym.",,,,,,,,,
144,,,,"Koharu! You can always train in here, if you want! That way, no one'll see you!",,,,,,,,,
144,,,,"Yeah, or maybe MEIKO will find you all alone, and you'll end up running for your life.",,,,,,,,,
144,,,,"Not true!! I'll defend her, so she can exercise in peace!!!",,,,,,,,,
144,,,,"…Thanks, Miku. I'll consider it.",,,,,,,,,
145,,,,"Aww, you two were so small!",,,,,,,,,
145,,,,Right! I can't believe she used to be taller than me. It feels forever ago.,,,,,,,,,
145,,,,S-Sanae…,,,,,,,,,
145,,,,"Hehe, sorry Chiyomi. I was showing Miku pictures of the girls, and I got sidetracked.",,,,,,,,,
145,,,,But aren't we cute in this one!? Remember when we had that field trip to the zoo?,,,,,,,,,
145,,,,Yeah. You punched our classmate for making fun of the giraffe's face…,,,,,,,,,
145,,,,I stand by that. He can't choose how he looks like. ,,,,,,,,,
145,,,,I know. It was for a good cause. ,,,,,,,,,
145,,,,"Hehe, it's nice that you two are so close. ",,,,,,,,,
146,,,,"Geez, you guys had me scared!! I thought Chiyomi got in the middle of a fight or something!!",,,,,,,,,
146,,,,Sorry… I was just curious about what kind of attacks Miku can do.,,,,,,,,,
146,,,,I can do lots!! I need to stay on top of my game if I want to keep MEIKO in check!,,,,,,,,,
146,,,,"…Too bad about the dummy, though.",,,,,,,,,
146,,,,Yeah… Oh well…,,,,,,,,,
146,,,,"Hey, since you're in the mood for battle, how about planning strategy? ",,,,,,,,,
146,,,,Strategy? But that's so boring…,,,,,,,,,
146,,,,"Still, it's good to be prepared! With things like this, it's 5% your physical skill and 95% how you apply it. Like basketball. ",,,,,,,,,
146,,,,"It could be fun… I kinda want to know about MEIKO's attacks, too.",,,,,,,,,
146,,,,"I mean, if you think it'll help! Okay!",,,,,,,,,
147,,,,"So that's the idea behind this, I think. It's how Koharu explained it to me, anyway.",,,,,,,,,
147,,,,Ohhhhh…,,,,,,,,,
147,,,,…You don't get it.,,,,,,,,,
147,,,,Nope!,,,,,,,,,
147,,,,"*sigh* That's fine. I heard that explaining your process out loud helps with understanding concepts, so at least I got something out of it.",,,,,,,,,
147,,,,"How about you, Chiyomi? You doing any better?",,,,,,,,,
147,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
147,,,,Maybe we should get Sanae or Koharu in here…,,,,,,,,,
147,,,,"No, I got it… Just give me a second.",,,,,,,,,
147,,,,"Sure, take your time. I'm gonna double check my work. ",,,,,,,,,
148,,,,"Hey, these are nice. I think this is my favorite. All the Miku's in it have such nice designs.",,,,,,,,,
148,,,,"Thanks… I started a new sketchbook right before we found SEKAI, and I got inspired.",,,,,,,,,
148,,,,"It's basically just concept art, though. I don't think I could convert these outfits to actual patterns… ",,,,,,,,,
148,,,,"Hey, don't worry about it. Those are two totally different skills. Get Koharu to do it or something.",,,,,,,,,
148,,,,"Besides, Miku doesn't seem to mind.",,,,,,,,,
148,,,,Tada! I tried copying your drawing! How is it?,,,,,,,,,
148,,,,"That's nice… We should probably get you your own sketchbook, though.",,,,,,,,,
149,,,,? What's going on here? Is this a surprise party?,,,,,,,,,
149,,,,"…I'm sorry Kaori, but this is an intervention!",,,,,,,,,
149,,,,I-I can't hide your habits anymore! I won't let you ruin your life!!!,,,,,,,,,
149,,,,I— what?,,,,,,,,,
149,,,,Miku told me all about it. What's this about you drinking in the back of the academy?!,,,,,,,,,
149,,,,…Drinking… soda..?,,,,,,,,,
149,,,,"Wait, Miku, don't tell me you believed my spiel about drinking my woes away. ",,,,,,,,,
149,,,,Well— I mean—!,,,,,,,,,
149,,,,"HA, that's cute. You're so gullible, Miku.",,,,,,,,,
149,,,,I just didn't want anyone else to find my stash. My mom will get on my case about following my trainer's diet.,,,,,,,,,
149,,,,Ohhhhhhhhh… okay! Everything's good!,,,,,,,,,
149,,,,"You, Sanae, don't have an excuse.",,,,,,,,,
149,,,,"Ahaha, sorry… Miku came to me in hysterics, so I kinda jumped the gun.",,,,,,,,,
150,,,,Should we take a break now? We've been practicing for a while.,,,,,,,,,
150,,,,"Sure, this feels like a good time to stop.",,,,,,,,,
150,,,,Really?! But I can keep going!!! I'm not tired at all!!,,,,,,,,,
150,,,,"I mean, yeah. You're magic. You're built different.",,,,,,,,,
150,,,,"If you want to keep going, you could… but it's nicer to take a break as a group, isn't it?",,,,,,,,,
150,,,,I guess you're right★ Can I have some of your soda?,,,,,,,,,
150,,,,Go for it. ,,,,,,,,,
150,,,,"Honestly, this is more my pace. I don't like having to take a bunch of breaks. Makes me feel like I'm not pushing myself enough.",,,,,,,,,
150,,,,I get it. I wanna get the most out of practice before I have to head out. ,,,,,,,,,
150,,,,"But like, I'm already pretty active, and you had a whole training regimen. Can't blame the others for struggling.",,,,,,,,,
150,,,,Well then. That just means we have to keep pushing them.,,,,,,,,,
150,,,,Why do I feel like you just want to antagonize Koharu…,,,,,,,,,
151,,,,"Toshi, what are your grades like?",,,,,,,,,
151,,,,"…Okay, I suppose.",,,,,,,,,
151,,,,"Are they ACTUALLY okay, or are you just saying that to be humble?",,,,,,,,,
151,,,,I suppose they could be better… I don't pay too much attention to them. I was more focused on brass band. ,,,,,,,,,
151,,,,"Geez, I thought you could be my tutor, but I think you need the help more than me.",,,,,,,,,
151,,,,"Sorry… I could start studying the material, if you'd like.",,,,,,,,,
151,,,,"You should be studying anyway???? Nevermind, let's just have a study session one day!",,,,,,,,,
152,,,,"So like, what's Rion like in class? Is she good at any subjects? Does she talk to anyone else?",,,,,,,,,
152,,,,Why are you asking me..?,,,,,,,,,
152,,,,Cuz we're friends now! It'll be totally weird if I didn't know these things.,,,,,,,,,
152,,,,"Anyway, what do you mean, why? Aren't you two are like, besties?",,,,,,,,,
152,,,,"Not really… We just sit next to each other, and sometimes we work on assignments together. We didn't really talk until we started having practice. ",,,,,,,,,
152,,,,"Then why was she always after YOU in brass band? And how come you were the only one she invited for practice?! That's totally not fair, y'know!",,,,,,,,,
152,,,,You ended up joining us anyway… I don't understand what the issue is.,,,,,,,,,
152,,,,"UGH, nevermind, you're clueless. Can you at least tell me where she might be sitting for lunch??",,,,,,,,,
152,,,,"Oh, I know this. She's probably in the library. She's on the committee.",,,,,,,,,
152,,,,"Ok! Thanks, Toshi~ Byebye!",,,,,,,,,
153,,,,"Oh my god. Toshi, Toshi, look at this!",,,,,,,,,
153,,,,? Is this your picshare page?,,,,,,,,,
153,,,,"No, it's some COPYCAT!!! I can't believe her. She totally stole. My. Look.",,,,,,,,,
153,,,,…I'm not understanding. How did she 'steal your look'?,,,,,,,,,
153,,,,Just LOOK at this!! She has the SAME SHOES and everything!!!,,,,,,,,,
153,,,,Oh… It just looks like a clown outfit to me. Isn't your theme supposed to be a jester..?,,,,,,,,,
153,,,,"Sigh… You're too innocent for this world, Toshiki. You have to be on the lookout for people like this!",,,,,,,,,
153,,,,Or else — BAM! — you'll get knocked down! Crushed underfoot! Like a bug.,,,,,,,,,
153,,,,Oh. ,,,,,,,,,
153,,,,…I think this is beyond me.,,,,,,,,,
154,,,,…Really? You want to go shopping with me??,,,,,,,,,
154,,,,"Like, not a joke? You're not messing with me?!",,,,,,,,,
154,,,,*Nod*,,,,,,,,,
154,,,,"My wardrobe is… somewhat dull, compared to yours. I want to try something new.",,,,,,,,,
154,,,,!!!!!!!,,,,,,,,,
154,,,,"TOSHIKI!!! Mark my words, we're going to dress you up so PRETTY!!! ",,,,,,,,,
154,,,,You're going to be a WHOLE new man! You're gonna be the TALK of SHIBUYA!!!,,,,,,,,,
154,,,,…Maybe not something so dramatic. I just want to try something different.,,,,,,,,,
154,,,,But thank you. I'm looking forward to it.,,,,,,,,,
155,,,,(I messed up just before the bridge…),,,,,,,,,
155,,,,"(I know that this song wasn't made for violin, but it's still frustrating…)",,,,,,,,,
155,,,,TOSHI!!!,,,,,,,,,
155,,,,?! Ami? Where did you come from?,,,,,,,,,
155,,,,"Damn, Rion was right, you *are* always practicing. I wanted to see for myself!",,,,,,,,,
155,,,,"Anyway, lemme join you! I got my guitar with me!!",,,,,,,,,
155,,,,(…),,,,,,,,,
155,,,,(I planned to practice on my own today…),,,,,,,,,
155,,,,"(…But it could be fun, playing out here together... I should at least give it a try.)",,,,,,,,,
155,,,,Ok. I'll help you set up.,,,,,,,,,
155,,,,"Wait, actually?!",,,,,,,,,
155,,,,SCORE!! Just gimme a second!,,,,,,,,,
156,,,,"So, whatcha think, Toshi? Pretty sweet, right?!",,,,,,,,,
156,,,,…I don't think we're allowed to touch the harp. The sign says we're supposed to stay behind the tape. ,,,,,,,,,
156,,,,"Ok, well, I just did. What are you gonna do, kill me?",,,,,,,,,
156,,,,"It's not that. It's just, I don't want you to get in trouble…",,,,,,,,,
156,,,,"Oh Toshiki, you sweet summer child… You're too pure for your own good.",,,,,,,,,
156,,,,"But this isn't an ACTUAL museum, right? If anything, Miku and Luka probably WANT us to play with everything! ",,,,,,,,,
156,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
156,,,,"So do you like it or not?!?!?! I practiced super hard on that, y'know!!!!!!!!!! ",,,,,,,,,
156,,,,"…I did enjoy it. Good job, Ami.",,,,,,,,,
156,,,,THAT'S what I wanted to hear! Now get ready for an encore!,,,,,,,,,
156,,,,(I hope she's right about not causing trouble…),,,,,,,,,
157,,,,"Keishiro, your CD. Thank you for letting me borrow it.",,,,,,,,,
157,,,,"Oh! Oh yeah, right, I forgot I lended you that.",,,,,,,,,
157,,,,"…Actually, I thought you forgot about giving it back… It's been… um. Two weeks. ",,,,,,,,,
157,,,,I wanted to make sure I understood the lyrics. I spent some time looking for translations. ,,,,,,,,,
157,,,,…Oh. I apologize if I took too long.,,,,,,,,,
157,,,,"Nonono!! It's fine!! Actually, I'm relieved. I was trying to find a way to bring it up.",,,,,,,,,
157,,,,"Also, I didn't really look too hard into the songs' meaning. I just like their music, so… You probably appreciated it more than I did. Ahaha.",,,,,,,,,
157,,,,There's nothing wrong with that either. Most people like music for music's sake.,,,,,,,,,
157,,,,"Yeah, I guess you have a point. ",,,,,,,,,
158,,,,"Keishiro, does your brother go to Kamiyama as well?",,,,,,,,,
158,,,,"H-huh? I mean, um, why?",,,,,,,,,
158,,,,"Just for curiosity's sake. I don't think I've seen him before, but I don't know the third-years too well.",,,,,,,,,
158,,,,"Ah… No, he goes to a different high school. An all boys' one.",,,,,,,,,
158,,,,"He gets out earlier than I do, so he just likes to show up sometimes. To surprise me.",,,,,,,,,
158,,,,I see… My sister's like that with me as well. ,,,,,,,,,
158,,,,"She's not as extreme as your brother, though. She mostly just checks in during lunch to see if I've eaten.",,,,,,,,,
158,,,,"Ha, that's nice of her. That's just how they show they care, I guess.",,,,,,,,,
158,,,,I suppose so…,,,,,,,,,
158,,,,"(I can't say Sanae's anything like him, though…)",,,,,,,,,
159,,,,Sorry I dragged you out here…,,,,,,,,,
159,,,,? I said that I'm fine with coming along. It's not a problem for me.,,,,,,,,,
159,,,,"Yeah, I guess… I just thought you might be busy with practice, so…",,,,,,,,,
159,,,,"Not particularly, no. A few hours away from my violin won't hurt.",,,,,,,,,
159,,,,"…Actually, Miku was the one who told me to take a break from practicing. So really, you're doing me a favor. ",,,,,,,,,
159,,,,"Oh! Ok, then that's fine. Here, the shop should be somewhere around here…",,,,,,,,,
159,,,,(Framing it like that worked… I'll have to keep that in mind for next time.),,,,,,,,,
160,,,,Thank you for bringing me here. I'm… very relieved there wasn't any permanent damage.,,,,,,,,,
160,,,,Of course!! The owner here is really knowledgable. I figured he would know what was going on with your violin.,,,,,,,,,
160,,,,"Is your instrument really 3 years old, though?! It's looks so new. ",,,,,,,,,
160,,,,Yes. I got it in middle school. ,,,,,,,,,
160,,,,"I was told that I was late to start… but I figured if I practiced everyday, I could reach an acceptable level. ",,,,,,,,,
160,,,,"Haha, if you're this good, then maybe there's hope for me, too…",,,,,,,,,
161,,,,"Toshiki, do you practice at home at all? ",,,,,,,,,
161,,,,"Not often… Usually, I either practice afterschool or on the street. Why?",,,,,,,,,
161,,,,I'm thinking of ways I can practice more without letting my brothers know. ,,,,,,,,,
161,,,,"The school has a drumkit I can use, but other students might need it… And I can use the drumkit here, but they'll get worried if they can't get a hold of me…",,,,,,,,,
161,,,,…Can you really not tell your family about the band?,,,,,,,,,
161,,,,My family still knows about my violin. Will yours not understand..?,,,,,,,,,
161,,,,…It'll just cause a bunch of trouble.,,,,,,,,,
161,,,,"Really, it's easier this way. I'll figure it out!",,,,,,,,,
161,,,,If you say so…,,,,,,,,,
162,,,,…Here.,,,,,,,,,
162,,,,Huh?! Really? Are you sure?,,,,,,,,,
162,,,,"Yes, it's fine. I bought water bottles just for practice. ",,,,,,,,,
162,,,,"…No, I can't take this from you. I really should've just brought my own—",,,,,,,,,
162,,,,That's why I bought them. So that you won't go thirsty. ,,,,,,,,,
162,,,,Please just take it. I don't want to drink if you're going to be thirsty in front of me.,,,,,,,,,
162,,,,"Ah, sorry—",,,,,,,,,
162,,,,I mean. Thank you for the water..!,,,,,,,,,
162,,,,Of course. ,,,,,,,,,
162,,,,(Finally…),,,,,,,,,
163,,,,You scared the shit out of me. I saw a big block of text and thought something serious happened. ,,,,,,,,,
163,,,,"If you wanted to eat lunch together, you could've said that in less words.",,,,,,,,,
163,,,,"I didn't want to impose on you, and I wanted to make sure I was being clear. I suppose I got carried away…",,,,,,,,,
163,,,,"…I appreciate it. But you're not imposing. If you were, then I'd tell you, honest.",,,,,,,,,
163,,,,"Actually, I was planning to ask if you wanted to grab lunch together, so it all worked out.",,,,,,,,,
163,,,,"…Seriously, you don't need to sit all the way over there. We look awkward as hell.",,,,,,,,,
163,,,,Oh. Ok.,,,,,,,,,
164,,,,? You've hardly touched your lunch. You don't like it?,,,,,,,,,
164,,,,"Ah, no, it's good. I'm just… a little tired of omelets.",,,,,,,,,
164,,,,"My sister wants me to eat well, but she ends up packing the same thing everyday… I used to like it a lot, so I think she's just used to making it.",,,,,,,,,
164,,,,"Aww, that's actually pretty sweet. Better than buying lunch all the time, anyway.",,,,,,,,,
164,,,,"Still, you don't look that happy about it. You should let her know if it's such an issue.",,,,,,,,,
164,,,,"I just don't want to cause her trouble, is all…",,,,,,,,,
164,,,,"Seriously?! Stand up, man. How's she gonna know if you don't tell her?",,,,,,,,,
164,,,,"...Ugh, don't look so sad. Nevermind, how about we swap? Take some fruit. ",,,,,,,,,
164,,,,"…Thank you. I'll warn you, mine's a little bland. ",,,,,,,,,
165,,,,"Thanks for coming with me. I've, um, been looking forward to this book for a while.",,,,,,,,,
165,,,,"Of course. Actually, I was curious about that. You mentioned spending lunch in the library, but I didn't take you for a reader.",,,,,,,,,
165,,,,"Yeah, the library's just cause I'm on the committee. No one really talks to me there, so I end up bored the entire time.",,,,,,,,,
165,,,,"—Not that I care. If anyone talks to me, I mean. Bunch of nerds and their bookclubs. ",,,,,,,,,
165,,,,I see…,,,,,,,,,
165,,,,"Besides, they don't know what they're missing out on. This series is real fun.",,,,,,,,,
165,,,,"Toshiki, you like death games? Murder mysteries? People getting their head bashed in?",,,,,,,,,
165,,,,Nevermind. You look freaked out just hearing about it.,,,,,,,,,
166,,,,All the way out here? Didn't you used to have a spot near Main Street?,,,,,,,,,
166,,,,"Ah… I used to. Apparently, I need a permit to perform there now.",,,,,,,,,
166,,,,Seriously? Who told you that?,,,,,,,,,
166,,,,"A storeowner… I didn't want to be a bother, so I just moved here. ",,,,,,,,,
166,,,,Tch. People play their guitars in the street all the time. Don't see why a violin's any different.,,,,,,,,,
166,,,,…Do you think he got annoyed with me?,,,,,,,,,
166,,,,"If he did, then he needs to get his ears checked. Seriously, don't think about it. You'll get yourself down.",,,,,,,,,
166,,,,Ok…,,,,,,,,,
167,,,,"Toshiki, you know if we can move the paintings? Or take them down?",,,,,,,,,
167,,,,I don't think so… I saw a plaque that said not to touch them.,,,,,,,,,
167,,,,"I know we're not *allowed to* But do you think they got laser systems, or cameras?",,,,,,,,,
167,,,,…You think they're watching us?,,,,,,,,,
167,,,,I don't want to find out. We could get in trouble.,,,,,,,,,
167,,,,Seriously? I don't know how you can feel safe in here.,,,,,,,,,
167,,,,"You don't know a single thing about this place, about those Virtual Singers, and you don't even want to find out.",,,,,,,,,
167,,,,"…Sorry, nevermind. I shouldn't rope you into this.",,,,,,,,,
167,,,,"Whatever you're planning, please don't get hurt.",,,,,,,,,
167,,,,"Yeah, I won't. I'm not stupid.",,,,,,,,,
168,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
168,,,,…What. You gonna stand there and gawk?,,,,,,,,,
168,,,,"What, what was—",,,,,,,,,
168,,,,Nothing anyone needed to see. Stupid gallery. Stupid SEKAI.,,,,,,,,,
168,,,,"Don't you dare back off now. If you go and tattle to Miku, I'll— I'll—",,,,,,,,,
168,,,,"No, Rion, I don't care about that!",,,,,,,,,
168,,,,I need to get bandages— you're bleeding. A lot. ,,,,,,,,,
168,,,,...Don't bother. This is what I get.,,,,,,,,,
168,,,,"Anyway, you don't need to look so worried. I should still be able to play—",,,,,,,,,
168,,,,(—Ah. He already ran off.),,,,,,,,,
168,,,,(…),,,,,,,,,
168,,,,"(Toshiki, why do you even bother with me…?)",,,,,,,,,
169,,,,KEISHI!!! Wanna grab lunch with me? ,,,,,,,,,
169,,,,"Oh! Oh, sorry Ami, I packed a lunch today…",,,,,,,,,
169,,,,"And I'm waiting for Hiroshi, so we can go over notes together. You should come sit with us when you're done, though! ",,,,,,,,,
169,,,,Oh… ,,,,,,,,,
169,,,,"Ahaha, nevermind!!! You have fun! I'm gonna go bother someone else~",,,,,,,,,
169,,,,Ami—?,,,,,,,,,
169,,,,(She ran off…),,,,,,,,,
169,,,,"(She's fine having lunch when it's the two of us, but when it comes to anyone else… I hope there isn't any bad blood between them…)",,,,,,,,,
170,,,,WOAH. What happened to your melon bun? It's burnt to a crisp!,,,,,,,,,
170,,,,"Oh, uh. I tried to make it myself. The recipe online said to bake for 30 minutes, but then it started to look like this…",,,,,,,,,
170,,,,You must've had the heat REALLY high for it to get that charred. Are you sure the inside's cooked?,,,,,,,,,
170,,,,"I mean, it's still edible! And anyway, I can't let it go to waste, so—",,,,,,,,,
170,,,,"Absolutely NOT!!!! That thing's a lost cause. Come on, let's get something from the cafeteria!",,,,,,,,,
170,,,,Aww…,,,,,,,,,
171,,,,"Come on, the light's gonna turn red!!!",,,,,,,,,
171,,,,We really shouldn't be running…,,,,,,,,,
171,,,,—!,,,,,,,,,
171,,,,"Ami, STOP!",,,,,,,,,
171,,,,What'd you do that for?? We could've totally made it!,,,,,,,,,
171,,,,"No, we wouldn't! Don't run in the road like that!! Wh, what if you got hit?!",,,,,,,,,
171,,,,"Relax, I do it, like, all the time. I haven't gotten run over yet~",,,,,,,,,
171,,,,"…Ok, ok, if you're THAT worried, I won't try it again. It'll suck if I can't play cuz all my bones are broken.",,,,,,,,,
171,,,,Thank god…,,,,,,,,,
171,,,,"Hehe, you're such a mom. But hurry it up next time! ",,,,,,,,,
172,,,,That was a nice performance! The bassist looked like he was having fun.,,,,,,,,,
172,,,,"Ami, have you ever thought of performing on the street like those guys? I bet you'd get a lot of attention.",,,,,,,,,
172,,,,"Eh… If it was like, with one of you guys, then sure. But DEFINITELY not alone!",,,,,,,,,
172,,,,Really?,,,,,,,,,
172,,,,"Yeah!! People will think I'm like, some friendless loser!!!",,,,,,,,,
172,,,,"If I'm gonna play in public, I wanna SHOW OFF!!! Like, with you guys!",,,,,,,,,
172,,,,"Ohhhhh, I get it! Yeah, I'd rather play as a band than all alone.",,,,,,,,,
172,,,,"I mean, not that I can drag a drumkit out here without getting stared at, haha…",,,,,,,,,
173,,,,"Keishi, don't you have, like, ANY socials outside of LINE?",,,,,,,,,
173,,,,"Um… not really… I guess I'm just not that online, haha…",,,,,,,,,
173,,,,That can't be right! Not even a Picshare?? ,,,,,,,,,
173,,,,I mean… it's a little dumb…,,,,,,,,,
173,,,,"So you ARE online!! Let me follow you, I'll hype you up!",,,,,,,,,
173,,,,It's not really a social though… It's just a blog for reviewing food I try.,,,,,,,,,
173,,,,"It's not that professional, honestly. I just started doing it because I was bored with my life. Nothing like your account, anyway.",,,,,,,,,
173,,,,"But it's *something*! I should make a blog too, I got a BUNCH of advice to give.",,,,,,,,,
173,,,,You should!! I'd definitely read it.,,,,,,,,,
174,,,,We did it!!!!,,,,,,,,,
174,,,,Yay!!!,,,,,,,,,
174,,,,Barely…,,,,,,,,,
174,,,,"Hey, this song was YOUR idea. If you wanted something easy, we should've played something we already knew.",,,,,,,,,
174,,,,"Ah, sorry, it's not that! You did really great. It was really fun.",,,,,,,,,
174,,,,"You got the hang of it so quickly, though… I feel like it takes me forever to find my rhythm.",,,,,,,,,
174,,,,"Well, duh. You only started, like, a month ago. ",,,,,,,,,
174,,,,"You better catch up, though! I have some songs I wanna play, and I want us to sound good when we do!",,,,,,,,,
174,,,,!! Right!! I'll keep practicing!,,,,,,,,,
175,,,,What the hell was that for?,,,,,,,,,
175,,,,They had it coming!!!,,,,,,,,,
175,,,,They weren't even doing anything??,,,,,,,,,
175,,,,"They were STARING. I can't STAND nosy people. Like, mind your own beeswax!!!!!",,,,,,,,,
175,,,,You really don't need to defend me. You're making it worse for yourself.,,,,,,,,,
175,,,,Absolutely not! No way am I going to let them look at you like that!! You're my friend!!,,,,,,,,,
175,,,,Where's your ANGER?? Where's your RAGE?!?! Aren't you supposed to be scary??,,,,,,,,,
175,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
175,,,,…Let's just find somewhere else to sit next time.,,,,,,,,,
176,,,,…Don't you want to wear something else?,,,,,,,,,
176,,,,And why would I want to do that?? I picked this out especially for today!! ,,,,,,,,,
176,,,,Cause it might get hot. We could be in line for a while. ,,,,,,,,,
176,,,,"Well, TOO BAD. You're stuck with me, and you're not getting out of photo-taking duty that easy!",,,,,,,,,
176,,,,And what're you gonna do if I ditch you anyway? ,,,,,,,,,
176,,,,"…I, um, well—",,,,,,,,,
176,,,,...Sorry. That was supposed to be a joke.,,,,,,,,,
176,,,,Let's just try and get there early. It'll be bad if you overheat before we get any good pictures. ,,,,,,,,,
176,,,,"—! Right! See, I knew you'd get it.",,,,,,,,,
177,,,,So? Whatcha think?? ,,,,,,,,,
177,,,,…It was fun.,,,,,,,,,
177,,,,"KNEW IT!!! I knew you'd like this place!!!! When I saw they were having a promotion, I HAD to bring you here!!",,,,,,,,,
177,,,,And YOU didn't want to come! You would've rather stayed home all day!,,,,,,,,,
177,,,,I didn't say all that.,,,,,,,,,
177,,,,KYAHAHA!! Exactly! My genius knows no bounds! ,,,,,,,,,
178,,,,"So you haven't been playing guitar for long, right?",,,,,,,,,
178,,,,"Nope! Like, a year or so, maybe.",,,,,,,,,
178,,,,"But I know what I'm doing!!! I've gotten good enough to perform, anyway!",,,,,,,,,
178,,,,"I see... You're probably better off than I am, then. I haven't touched my bass in a while…",,,,,,,,,
178,,,,"Don't say that! You have more experience on me in general, so it balances out. Like PEMDAS.",,,,,,,,,
178,,,,"OH, I know! How about we swap instruments for a day? Then we can both start from scratch!",,,,,,,,,
178,,,,Hm. Could be fun.,,,,,,,,,
178,,,,Hmph. Such a dull expression. You're just saying that.,,,,,,,,,
178,,,,…Yayyyyy?,,,,,,,,,
178,,,,That's more like it!,,,,,,,,,
179,,,,No.,,,,,,,,,
179,,,,Yes!!! ,,,,,,,,,
179,,,,You're not paying for me. ,,,,,,,,,
179,,,,"I AM, and there's nothing you can do about it!",,,,,,,,,
179,,,,Fine. Then I won't buy anything. ,,,,,,,,,
179,,,,Then I'll buy it anyway and gift it to you!,,,,,,,,,
179,,,,Are you serious? Why are pushing so hard for this??,,,,,,,,,
179,,,,Because we're friends and I want to!!! Now let me pay!!!!,,,,,,,,,
179,,,,I'm not going to be in your debt. Just let me pay for my own strings.,,,,,,,,,
179,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
179,,,,…Ok. How about we each pay 50/50? Will that work?,,,,,,,,,
179,,,,Deal!,,,,,,,,,
179,,,,(I'll find a way to pay her back without her realizing…),,,,,,,,,
180,,,,Blah. I keep messing up this part…,,,,,,,,,
180,,,,"Don't worry about it, that's what practice is for. It's not like anyone's really listening to us out here.",,,,,,,,,
180,,,,But are you sure you want to play this song? We can always start with something a bit more easier.,,,,,,,,,
180,,,,"What, you think I can't do it??",,,,,,,,,
180,,,,"What? No, that's not what I meant—",,,,,,,,,
180,,,,I CAN TOTALLY DO THIS!! One more go!!! I'll prove myself to you!!! ,,,,,,,,,
180,,,,"Okay, okay, I hear you. ",,,,,,,,,
181,,,,"…Um, Rion?",,,,,,,,,
181,,,,Hm?,,,,,,,,,
181,,,,"We're friends, right?",,,,,,,,,
181,,,,? Of course we are. You're the one who's always saying that.,,,,,,,,,
181,,,,"You're sure? You, like, *like* me? ",,,,,,,,,
181,,,,"I wouldn't be here if I didn't. What, you want me to say I hate your guts?",,,,,,,,,
181,,,,"Seriously, what is this about? Are you trying to get out of practice?",,,,,,,,,
181,,,,What? No way!! I just waited forever for you to show up!!! ,,,,,,,,,
181,,,,"GEEZ, nevermind, you won't get it! Come on, we're already WAY behind schedule!",,,,,,,,,
181,,,,"Coming, coming…",,,,,,,,,
182,,,,Thanks for explaining all this… You really didn't have to. The notes would've been enough.,,,,,,,,,
182,,,,Of course!! It's not a problem at all.,,,,,,,,,
182,,,,"Still… I mean, I really didn't mind helping, but couldn't you have asked Toshiki? You're in the same class, after all.",,,,,,,,,
182,,,,…I guess. I just didn't want to bother him. ,,,,,,,,,
182,,,,"We always end up working together in class, and I was always after him in brass band. If I keep this up, he might get tired of me.",,,,,,,,,
182,,,,"Ahaha, I know what you mean… I don't think Toshiki's that kinda guy, though.",,,,,,,,,
183,,,,Seriously? They took your textbook?,,,,,,,,,
183,,,,"They didn't *take* it. I let them borrow it, and they lost it somewhere…",,,,,,,,,
183,,,,Fuck that. They totally did it on purpose. ,,,,,,,,,
183,,,,"I mean, I don't think they did… They apologized and everything.",,,,,,,,,
183,,,,Cause they knew you wouldn't make a scene. You'd let them get away with it.,,,,,,,,,
183,,,,"Look, Keishiro, you tell them to either pay up or find it, or I'll do it for you. ",,,,,,,,,
183,,,,Rion…,,,,,,,,,
183,,,,"Whether or not it was on purpose, it's the least they can do. ",,,,,,,,,
183,,,,…I guess you're right… I'll talk to them.,,,,,,,,,
184,,,,This advertisement…,,,,,,,,,
184,,,,"Rion, um, sorry if this is weird, but do you know this lady? She has the same last name, so I thought…",,,,,,,,,
184,,,,Huh. I didn't realize the concert was this soon. So that's what Mom was preparing for. ,,,,,,,,,
184,,,,Oh? She's your mom?!,,,,,,,,,
184,,,,"That's so cool! I didn't know she was a conductor. No wonder you're in brass band, you must have a bunch of experience.",,,,,,,,,
184,,,,"No, that doesn't have anything to do with it. I got forced into helping out. It's basically community service.",,,,,,,,,
184,,,,"…She wanted me to learn viola, but I ditched it for bass. So I guess this is karma. ",,,,,,,,,
184,,,,Oh… sorry for bringing it up.,,,,,,,,,
184,,,,"You're good. It's what I get, anyway.",,,,,,,,,
184,,,,But! I mean! That's not true!,,,,,,,,,
184,,,,"If you like bass, then it makes sense that you'd focus on it. There's nothing karmic about that.",,,,,,,,,
184,,,,…I appreciate it. Maybe you can tell that to her.,,,,,,,,,
185,,,,You looking for someone?,,,,,,,,,
185,,,,? Huh?,,,,,,,,,
185,,,,You keep turning around and searching the crowd. Is there someone I should be looking out for? ,,,,,,,,,
185,,,,"No, no, it's nothing like that!! I just thought I saw my brother here. ",,,,,,,,,
185,,,,Really? You're being so jumpy. Don't tell me he's being a problem for you.,,,,,,,,,
185,,,,"Really, he's not… He likes to look out for me. He can just be, uh, kinda overbearing. ",,,,,,,,,
185,,,,…Hmph. No peace of mind with people like that.,,,,,,,,,
185,,,,What did you say?,,,,,,,,,
185,,,,"I *said*, I'm not dealing with this. We're finding a store to get lost in.",,,,,,,,,
185,,,,"R-Really, Rion, I'm just checking, he's probably not even—",,,,,,,,,
185,,,,Ow! Sorry! I'm coming!!    No need to pull...,,,,,,,,,
186,,,,"Ugh… I keep messing up the tempo at this part… Sorry, Rion… ",,,,,,,,,
186,,,,What are you apologizing to me for? It's not hurting me.,,,,,,,,,
186,,,,But it's messing up your timing too. Maybe I should just do more solo practice…,,,,,,,,,
186,,,,"Seriously, it's no big deal. You're new to this, so it's expected.",,,,,,,,,
186,,,,"Besides, I'm out of practice too. And I don't want to practice alone. ",,,,,,,,,
186,,,,"Oh! Okay, if you really don't mind!",,,,,,,,,
187,,,,Holy shit. How did this even happen??,,,,,,,,,
187,,,,It was an accident! I swear!! It just— It just happened!,,,,,,,,,
187,,,,Seriously? It's completely shattered. I don't even know what this was supposed to be.,,,,,,,,,
187,,,,"I mean, I guess we could have Miku and Luka check it out… They might know how to fix it.",,,,,,,,,
187,,,,"…Do they have to? Can't we just, just hide this?",,,,,,,,,
187,,,,They don't need to know. They won't even notice it's gone.,,,,,,,,,

187,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
187,,,,"Y'know what, sure. I don't really want to talk to them either. Luka asks too many questions. ",,,,,,,,,
187,,,,"Come on, let's find a place to dump this. ",,,,,,,,,
187,,,,"!!! Yeah, right!",,,,,,,,,
187,,,,(Thank god…),,,,,,,,,
188,,,,— ♪,,,,,,,,,
188,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
188,,,,(She's been listening to me practice this section for the past hour…),,,,,,,,,
188,,,,(She hasn't said a word. I wonder what she's thinking…),,,,,,,,,
188,,,,"So, Miku… What do you think?",,,,,,,,,
188,,,,Hmm…,,,,,,,,,
188,,,,This part is very intense. There's a painful need to be heard behind it. I'm sure people have pushed themselves and their instrument to the point of injury to convey it. ,,,,,,,,,
188,,,,Ruining yourself in pursuit of performance as an expression of intensity… Like a valve bursting under pressure.,,,,,,,,,
188,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
188,,,,"But if someone were to do that, over and over… Breaking oneself, knowing they were break again with the next performance, will that intensity still shine through? Does it cheapen one's feelings? ",,,,,,,,,
188,,,,"Did Guiness World Records truly discontinue 'most guitars smashed during a concert tour' out of guitar welfare? Or did the deaths of these instruments become cheap, pointless?",,,,,,,,,
188,,,,"Now, Toshiki, what do *you* think?",,,,,,,,,
188,,,,          ...I don't know. I wasn't thinking about any of that.,,,,,,,,,
188,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
188,,,,*sigh*,,,,,,,,,
188,,,,(She left.),,,,,,,,,
188,,,,(What did she want me to say? I don't get her at all…),,,,,,,,,
189,,,,…A curfew?,,,,,,,,,
189,,,,"Not a hard one, but yes. I wanted to inform you ahead of tonight.",,,,,,,,,
189,,,,"Sorry, Toshiki. But you're practicing here too late in the night. You need to sleep properly. ",,,,,,,,,
189,,,,…*sigh*,,,,,,,,,
189,,,,You don't look convinced.,,,,,,,,,
189,,,,"To be frank, Toshiki, your habits have me concerned. Practicing alone in the state that you're in does nothing to help you.",,,,,,,,,
189,,,,I don't mind if it doesn't sound the best. It's just for my peace of mind.,,,,,,,,,
189,,,,I'm not talking about your technical skills. ,,,,,,,,,
189,,,,Go home and get some sleep. Your family will worry if you stay out too late. ,,,,,,,,,
189,,,,Ok… fine…,,,,,,,,,
190,,,,"Miku, you're such a SNAKE!! You said you liked it when I did your hair!!! ",,,,,,,,,
190,,,,I do like it when you do my hair. ,,,,,,,,,
190,,,,"Then what the hell is this?! This isn't how I styled it!!! Don't tell me it's, like, Miku magic.",,,,,,,,,
190,,,,"No, it's not. I wanted to try my hand at styling, too.",,,,,,,,,
190,,,,"Hmph. I had an idea I wanted to try, too…",,,,,,,,,
190,,,,"You can still try it, if you want. I didn't say you can't do my hair anymore. ",,,,,,,,,
190,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
190,,,,"Okay, fine. But tell me if you're going to mess with it the second I turn my back.",,,,,,,,,
190,,,,Okay. I'm looking forward to what you're planning.,,,,,,,,,
191,,,,"..? Ami, what are all these accessories for?",,,,,,,,,
191,,,,Um…,,,,,,,,,
191,,,,"Sorry for calling you a snake… I didn't mean it, and… and anyway, I shouldn't have said that.",,,,,,,,,
191,,,,"I kinda didn't know which you'd like, so I just chose a bunch for you to pick.",,,,,,,,,
191,,,,"Actually, take them all!!! Not like I want them. ",,,,,,,,,
191,,,,Really? I think this one would look cute on you. We can be matching. ,,,,,,,,,
191,,,,You really want to match with someone like me?,,,,,,,,,
191,,,,"Of course. No hard feelings, Ami. ",,,,,,,,,
192,,,,"Um—! Miku, I was wondering, do you know any other instruments?",,,,,,,,,
192,,,,Unfortunately not. I'm only well-versed in violin.,,,,,,,,,
192,,,,"I've been wanting to try my hand at another instrument, but I haven't had the opportunity…",,,,,,,,,
192,,,,"Ah, I see… I was hoping you could help me with learning drums… but that's fine!",,,,,,,,,
192,,,,"..! Actually, if you want to learn something new, I could help! I've tried a lot of different instruments before this, so— I mean, I'm no expert, but…",,,,,,,,,
192,,,,What kind of instruments do you have?,,,,,,,,,
192,,,,"I'd have to go back and rent them out again, but I've tried cello, contrabass, flute…",,,,,,,,,
192,,,,"Clarinet, viola, trombone… Um, I'm forgetting one…",,,,,,,,,
192,,,,So many..?,,,,,,,,,
192,,,,"Ahaha, I wasn't that great at any of them… But there's lots of options!",,,,,,,,,
192,,,,"In that case… Thank you, Keishiro. I'm looking forward to it.",,,,,,,,,
193,,,,Wha— Miku! What happened to the clock?!,,,,,,,,,
193,,,,Well… It's broken. ,,,,,,,,,
193,,,,…I see that…,,,,,,,,,
193,,,,"And then I decided, since it was already broken, that I'd disassemble it some more. I just need to find the part that needs replacing.",,,,,,,,,
193,,,,…Do you know what needs replacing?,,,,,,,,,
193,,,,No.,,,,,,,,,
193,,,,Can you pass me the tweezers?,,,,,,,,,
193,,,,"Oh! Um, sure!",,,,,,,,,
193,,,,"Thanks. Maybe if we work together, we can fix it before Luka catches us.",,,,,,,,,
193,,,,(Why am I getting roped into this..?!),,,,,,,,,
194,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
194,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
194,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
194,,,,Hello.,,,,,,,,,
194,,,,You got a problem?,,,,,,,,,
194,,,,Not that I know of. Why?,,,,,,,,,
194,,,,"Cause you've been waiting around for the past— what, ten minutes? Do you need something?",,,,,,,,,
194,,,,So you've noticed. I wanted to ask if I can try stringing your bass.,,,,,,,,,
194,,,,Really? Do you even know how to string a guitar? Your violin doesn't count.,,,,,,,,,
194,,,,Ami showed me how she does hers. I want to try my hand at it on my own.,,,,,,,,,
194,,,,"No. This is my instrument, I'll do it myself. ",,,,,,,,,
194,,,,"I understand. Have a good practice session, Rion. ",,,,,,,,,
194,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
194,,,,(...At least she listens.),,,,,,,,,
195,,,,"Rion, a word with you?",,,,,,,,,
195,,,,? What gives? I need to meet up with the others.,,,,,,,,,
195,,,,Please be careful. I've been finding quite a few broken frames lately.,,,,,,,,,
195,,,,"I haven't swept this room throughly yet, so there might still be glass. You should go around the side.",,,,,,,,,
195,,,,...,,,,,,,,,
195,,,,"…Personally, I'm relieved. It's less stuff I'll have to organize. No point in keeping mementos we don't need. ",,,,,,,,,
195,,,,"Luka's a bit of a hoarder, though. I'm sorry if she's been troubling you guys over it.",,,,,,,,,
195,,,,"…Um, right— no, she hasn't been bothering us. ",,,,,,,,,
195,,,,"Can I go now? I'm not in trouble, right?",,,,,,,,,
195,,,,Of course. I won't hold you.,,,,,,,,,
195,,,,But please do let us know if there's anything we need to get rid of. We'll be happy to help.,,,,,,,,,
195,,,,"…Sure, whatever. I'll let you know.",,,,,,,,,
196,,,,"So how far does the SEKAI go? I've looked around, and this place is like, super big!",,,,,,,,,
196,,,,"It depends. Sometimes the rooms get moved around, so I haven't had the chance to properly map it out for myself.",,,,,,,,,
196,,,,Moved… around?,,,,,,,,,
196,,,,Yes? Do they not do that in your world?,,,,,,,,,
196,,,,"NO?? Buildings don't just change like that!!! That's super weird, you know.",,,,,,,,,
196,,,,"Fascinating… In any case, it might be best for you to stay nearby. ",,,,,,,,,
196,,,,"If you wander far enough, and you can't find your way back… something might find you.",,,,,,,,,
196,,,,—!,,,,,,,,,
196,,,,…Hehe.,,,,,,,,,
196,,,,"—Wait, are you messing with us?!",,,,,,,,,
196,,,,MIKU!!! Don't just walk away!!!!!! ,,,,,,,,,
197,,,,NICE!!!! You basically got it in the bag!!!,,,,,,,,,
197,,,,"Learn some more chords, and you can basically play anything you want!",,,,,,,,,
197,,,,"I see…! Thank you, Ami. Do you have any recommendations for songs?",,,,,,,,,
197,,,,"Sure!! Here, I'll show you the app I used to find tabs. Its separated by experience level, so you'll def find something you like.",,,,,,,,,
197,,,,You learned that so quickly…,,,,,,,,,
197,,,,"It's different than what I'm used to, but it's not unfamiliar… the picking is where I'm struggling the most.",,,,,,,,,
197,,,,"Toshiki, did you want to try your hand at it?",,,,,,,,,
197,,,,"No, thank you… I have my violin.",,,,,,,,,
197,,,,"What, are you married to it or something? ",,,,,,,,,
197,,,,"OOOH, Miku, here's a song I like! Try this!",,,,,,,,,
198,,,,Toshiki… help…,,,,,,,,,
198,,,,? What is going on..?,,,,,,,,,
198,,,,Is that a bow and arrow?!,,,,,,,,,
198,,,,"Oh, Toshiki, perfect timing. Watch this, I finally figured out how to draw it back properly. ",,,,,,,,,
198,,,,…Or not.,,,,,,,,,
198,,,,Where… where did she get that?,,,,,,,,,
198,,,,Um… It was supposed to be part of an exhibit… then she asked me to help take it down so she can try it…,,,,,,,,,
198,,,,And then she had me set up a bunch of apples as targets…,,,,,,,,,
198,,,,Do either of you want to try it?,,,,,,,,,
198,,,,Ahahaha no I'm good!!! Really!!!        Pleaseputthatdown..,,,,,,,,,
198,,,,Could you put it away…?,,,,,,,,,
198,,,,Very well. Thank you both for indulging me.,,,,,,,,,
198,,,,"If Luka asks, I had nothing to do with this.",,,,,,,,,
198,,,,…I don't remember how it was supposed to be set up before…,,,,,,,,,
198,,,,Maybe we should get Luka's help…,,,,,,,,,
199,,,,I do wish that the SEKAI stayed consistant…,,,,,,,,,
199,,,,Really? I think it's nice when they change the exhibits! It's like a real museum.,,,,,,,,,
199,,,,"I can understand that. But I don't understand why the building layout has to change, too.",,,,,,,,,
199,,,,"Oh, yeah, that's kinda weird… but, I mean, SEKAI's kinda weird as a concept. ",,,,,,,,,
199,,,,"No idea how you do it, Miku! I'd get super lost, ahaha.",,,,,,,,,
199,,,,"On the contrary, I enjoy it. It would be much more boring if I knew what to expect when I enter a room.",,,,,,,,,
199,,,,I say you take it as a lesson. You can't always rely on yesterday's knowledge to navigate today's path.,,,,,,,,,
199,,,,…I don't like it.,,,,,,,,,
199,,,,"It's okay, Toshiki. We don't need to wander far, anyway.",,,,,,,,,
199,,,,"The lobby seems to stay the same, so we can just stay around here!",,,,,,,,,
200,,,,…We've gotta do something about her.,,,,,,,,,
200,,,,"? Who, Miku?",,,,,,,,,
200,,,,"I mean, just look at her. She's going through zoochosis, or something. This is the tenth time she's circled through here.",,,,,,,,,
200,,,,Oh. I thought she was just taking a walk…,,,,,,,,,
200,,,,…I just can't understand why she'd be bored. This is a perfect place to practice her violin. And there's no shortage of exhibits set up… ,,,,,,,,,
200,,,,"Well, I'm the one who has to keep track of those exhibits.",,,,,,,,,
200,,,,—!,,,,,,,,,
200,,,,Oh. Hello Miku.    How are you..?,,,,,,,,,
200,,,,Just killing time. Are you two here to practice?,,,,,,,,,
200,,,,"I mean, I wasn't.",,,,,,,,,
200,,,,Aw.,,,,,,,,,
200,,,,…But I can go back and grab my bass if it keeps you busy.,,,,,,,,,
200,,,,! Wonderful. I'm looking forward to it.,,,,,,,,,
200,,,,Now I guess I have to… You gonna join me? ,,,,,,,,,
200,,,,Oh. I was going to go outside… ,,,,,,,,,
200,,,,But I suppose I could have my practice here today.,,,,,,,,,
201,,,,"Miku, tell Luka to knock it off with the whole, ""SEKAI owner"" thing.",,,,,,,,,
201,,,,? Is there an issue?,,,,,,,,,
201,,,,"I have a name, and she doesn't use it half the time.",,,,,,,,,
201,,,,And it's just weird. What did I do for her to worship the ground I walk on?? All I did was show up. ,,,,,,,,,
201,,,,"Toshiki, you know what I mean, right? It's super uncomfortable.",,,,,,,,,
201,,,,"…I agree. But I thought she might have a good reason for it, so I let it be…",,,,,,,,,
201,,,,"Screw her reasons. If she wants to be accommodating, she can start by opening her ears.",,,,,,,,,
201,,,,…I'll talk to her. I'm sorry she isn't listening.,,,,,,,,,
201,,,,Thanks. Maybe it'll mean something coming from you.,,,,,,,,,
202,,,,"Keishi, Miku, how's your bracelets going?",,,,,,,,,
202,,,,"I think I got the hang of it!! Look, I even added another row to make it wider.",,,,,,,,,
202,,,,"OOOOH, nice!! That's, like, next level!!",,,,,,,,,
202,,,,"Miku, what about you—",,,,,,,,,
202,,,,? That's a snake.,,,,,,,,,
202,,,,It is. I copied Keishiro's technique to make its face.,,,,,,,,,
202,,,,Hissssssss.,,,,,,,,,
202,,,,"Noooooooo, don't eat mine!",,,,,,,,,
202,,,,No way!!!! How are you two going to be better at this than ME?,,,,,,,,,
202,,,,"Keishiroooooooo, show me how you did it. I'll copy yours.",,,,,,,,,
202,,,,"Oh, ok, sure! See, I just kinda looped it through like this…",,,,,,,,,
203,,,,Having lunch in SEKAI is a great idea. It's so much more peaceful here compared to the school…,,,,,,,,,
203,,,,"I know, right?! And Miku's here too!! WAY better company than any of our classmates.",,,,,,,,,
203,,,,"Here, Miku, I got ya a sandwich from the cafeteria!!!",,,,,,,,,
203,,,,"A sandwich… Thank you, Ami. I will cherish this.",,,,,,,,,
203,,,,"I mean, even so… Ami, you should have lunch with me one day. I can introduce you to my other friends. ",,,,,,,,,
203,,,,"Like Hiroshi! You know, he's in our class. He's cool when you get to know him.",,,,,,,,,
203,,,,"Hmph. I don't trust him. He has that face, like, he's judging me for being too cool for him.",,,,,,,,,
203,,,,What? No way. He's just kinda antisocial… ,,,,,,,,,
203,,,,*munch* How about I meet this Hiroshi? I'd like to see him for myself.,,,,,,,,,
203,,,,"I wish! You could be my bodyguard, and inspect everyone who looks at me funny.",,,,,,,,,
203,,,,"Ahaha, sorry Miku… I don't think that's allowed…",,,,,,,,,
203,,,,"But Ami, if you ever want to hang out with us, just let me know. ",,,,,,,,,
203,,,,"Yeah yeah, fine. Maybe in, like, a year. Or three.",,,,,,,,,
204,,,,What the hell happened here??? Why are all the paintings taken down?,,,,,,,,,
204,,,,"Miku, is this another one of your projects? Can we help?",,,,,,,,,
204,,,,"Oh! Hello you two. Actually, I do need some assistance.",,,,,,,,,
204,,,,Don't drag me into this…,,,,,,,,,
204,,,,"Hmm... Actually, Rion, if you could just keep an eye out for Luka, that would be greatly appreciated.",,,,,,,,,
204,,,,"Ami, could you help me replace this painting?",,,,,,,,,
204,,,,"? What's the point of that? These two paintings are like, EXACTLY the same.",,,,,,,,,
204,,,,Not quite. This is a replica.,,,,,,,,,
204,,,,"I'm trying to see how many times I can replace the paintings in this gallery before Luka notices. My personal Ship of Theseus, if you will.",,,,,,,,,
204,,,,"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh, so it's a prank! LOL, sure, I'll totally help.",,,,,,,,,
204,,,,You really are bored.,,,,,,,,,
204,,,,This is why I don't let you touch my bass. You'd start trying to disassemble it or something.,,,,,,,,,
204,,,,"Even if I do disassemble it, it should be fine as long as it's reassembled correctly, right?",,,,,,,,,
204,,,,Or are you of the opinion that replacing its components wouldn't make it yours anymore?,,,,,,,,,
204,,,,Don't get philosophical with me! Hurry it up before Luka comes down this hall.,,,,,,,,,
205,,,,"Ughhhhhhhhhh. Tuning SUCKS. Miku, you do it.",,,,,,,,,
205,,,,"Okay. Do you have a tuner you'd like me to use, or…?",,,,,,,,,
205,,,,"Nah, I'm just using an app. I'd get a clip-on, but I'm too lazy.",,,,,,,,,
205,,,,You're always buying accessories and clothes though… You can't invest in a decent tuner?,,,,,,,,,
205,,,,"H-hey!! If it works, it works!!! And don't bring my wardrobe budget into this, that's, like, TOTALLY different!!",,,,,,,,,
205,,,,"Right, right. I'm just messing with you. It's not like we're professionals.",,,,,,,,,
205,,,,"...Honestly, it's such a relief to not have to worry about sounding perfect.",,,,,,,,,
205,,,,"I mean, I DO wanna sound good. I'm not gonna let ANYONE call us a bunch of frauds.",,,,,,,,,
205,,,,"But like, what're they gonna do if my guitar's a little offtune? Jump up on stage and kill me?",,,,,,,,,
205,,,,MIKUUU!!! Are you done with—,,,,,,,,,
205,,,,Huh? Since when did you have a tuner pedal?!,,,,,,,,,
205,,,,— ♪,,,,,,,,,
205,,,,You're welcome. ,,,,,,,,,
205,,,,"Are you trying to embarrass me or something? If you have something like that, you should've showed me!",,,,,,,,,
205,,,,"Just a demonstration. Here, I'll show you how to use it. It's quite simple.",,,,,,,,,
205,,,,"Bet!! See Rion, I didn't need to buy a tuner after all~",,,,,,,,,
206,,,,"Ah! Rion, Keishiro.",,,,,,,,,
206,,,,"Oh, hi Miku!! You seem happy.",,,,,,,,,
206,,,,Really? I could hardly tell.,,,,,,,,,
206,,,,"Yes, something exciting just happened. I took inventory of the minatures, and there's one missing. ",,,,,,,,,
206,,,,…Oh.,,,,,,,,,
206,,,,Isn't it thrilling? Never have I had a piece go missing. I wonder where it went.,,,,,,,,,
206,,,,Maybe I'll find it in one of the other galleries. Maybe it'll be in the trash. The possibilities are endless.,,,,,,,,,
206,,,,"I see..! Well! We won't disturb you, then!",,,,,,,,,
206,,,,Have fun… finding? it?,,,,,,,,,
206,,,,I will. Please do tell me if you happen to see it. ,,,,,,,,,
206,,,,...Ghh. She's way too thorough. ,,,,,,,,,
206,,,,I just hope she doesn't find out about the props I broke…,,,,,,,,,
207,,,,"Miku, stop roping Keishiro into your weird experiments. People are gonna ask questions if he heads out of here covered in paint.",,,,,,,,,
207,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
207,,,,"My apologies, Keishiro…",,,,,,,,,
207,,,,It's fine! I'll just wash it when I get home…,,,,,,,,,
207,,,,Why do you need one of us for this anyway? Restoring paintings? Do it in your own time.,,,,,,,,,
207,,,,Luka doesn't like it when I touch the exhibits. She says it's sacrilegious. ,,,,,,,,,
207,,,,"But you're the SEKAI owners, so she'll be okay if I say it was your idea.",,,,,,,,,
207,,,,So you're pushing the blame on us?! ,,,,,,,,,
207,,,,"I mean..! It was fun, so I don't really mind.",,,,,,,,,
208,,,,"Yurina, how long have you had your hair dyed?",,,,,,,,,
208,,,,"Three years, I think? I've only been green for a couple of months, though. Why, wanna get your hair done?",,,,,,,,,
208,,,,"I was thinking about it! Imagine how cool I'd look★ Hiro, you should dye your hair too!",,,,,,,,,
208,,,,It could be fun…,,,,,,,,,
208,,,,"Hold on, does Miya's even let you dye your hair? Don't get yourself kicked out. ",,,,,,,,,
208,,,,"It might depend on how obvious it is. As long as you're not, like, rainbow. What color were you thinking?",,,,,,,,,
208,,,,"Umm, I dunno. Maybe white?",,,,,,,,,
208,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
208,,,,*Seriously?*,,,,,,,,,
208,,,,"It's not like that! Forget about DIOS for a second, you don't think it'll look super cool!?",,,,,,,,,
208,,,,"You're already cool. Just stay purple. Yurina, tell her to stay purple. ",,,,,,,,,
208,,,,"I don't think I could do white, anyway. With hair as dark as yours, it'll take forever to get it right. ",,,,,,,,,
208,,,,Aww…,,,,,,,,,
208,,,,"Oh well, I'll think of a different color then.",,,,,,,,,
209,,,,"So when you two make music together, do you have specific roles? Or do you both do a bit of everything?",,,,,,,,,
209,,,,"Well, Hiroshi's really good at sound design! He has like, all these fancy keyboards with knobs and stuff! So he does that.",,,,,,,,,
209,,,,"It's not a keyboard, it's a synthesizer… but yeah, I do sound design. And mixing, mostly. Mayuko doesn't have the patience for it.",,,,,,,,,
209,,,,"And I do guitar! But everything else, it just kinda depends. We go back and forth a lot.",,,,,,,,,
209,,,,Man. I don't know if I could handle collabing like that. I think I'd end up railroading the entire song. ,,,,,,,,,
209,,,,"Yeah, it happens sometimes.",,,,,,,,,
209,,,,"Sorryyyyy… But we're good, right? ",,,,,,,,,
209,,,,"Yeah, don't worry. We're good. ",,,,,,,,,
210,,,,See? Told you we weren't lost. And we even got donuts along the way.,,,,,,,,,
210,,,,"Next time, can't we just use the maps app..? It took an extra hour just to find our way back.",,,,,,,,,
210,,,,"Yeah, but you'll never develop any navigational skills like that. What if your phone dies while you're out, or you lose signal?",,,,,,,,,
210,,,,Then I'd ask someone for help..? ,,,,,,,,,
210,,,,I thought it was fun ★ I got to see a bunch of shops I didn't know about! ,,,,,,,,,
210,,,,"See, Mayuko gets it. That's how I discovered this pastry place to begin with.",,,,,,,,,
210,,,,"Anyway, y'all have fun. I'm gonna drop these off at VISR.",,,,,,,,,
211,,,,You two went looking for an exit? Why??,,,,,,,,,
211,,,,"Did Untitled stopped working for you? That'd be like, an actual emergency.",,,,,,,,,
211,,,,"No, it wasn't like that! We were just curious!",,,,,,,,,
211,,,,"I mean, it's weird, isn't it? A single livehouse can't be this big. At some point, it has to end.",,,,,,,,,
211,,,,"Maybe if this was the real world. It's probably, like, backrooms logic. ",,,,,,,,,
211,,,,"Aww, that's kinda sad… Maybe that's why Miku's so grumpy all the time. She never goes outside. ",,,,,,,,,
211,,,,"In that case, maybe we should try to get her to visit us more often. ",,,,,,,,,
212,,,,"Thanks for helping out. Usually I have to make multiple trips for these, so it's appreciated.",,,,,,,,,
212,,,,No prob! Looking at all those speakers was really fun ★,,,,,,,,,
212,,,,"Ugh… I didn't think these would be so bulky, though… they looked tiny in comparision to the others.",,,,,,,,,
212,,,,"Wedge monitors. I've been putting off upgrading them. Hopefully, these don't cause as many problems for me.",,,,,,,,,
212,,,,"Oh, light's green. Keep up, you two.",,,,,,,,,
212,,,,"Hiroshi, race ya to the other side!",,,,,,,,,
212,,,,No way in hell. I'm not paying for this if it breaks.,,,,,,,,,
213,,,,Hmm…,,,,,,,,,
213,,,,Hi~ro~shi! We're back!,,,,,,,,,
213,,,,What were you looking at? Were you thinking of buying an instrument?,,,,,,,,,
213,,,,"Ah, no… They have a book on sound design here.",,,,,,,,,
213,,,,"I already have a digital copy, but I was thinking if I should buy a physical version too…",,,,,,,,,
213,,,,"You should go for it! That way, you can put sticky notes and annotations on it.",,,,,,,,,
213,,,,Hm. Do you think you'll read it again if you had a copy?,,,,,,,,,
213,,,,"Maybe… probably not. It helped me in the past, so it would just be nice to have a physical copy.",,,,,,,,,
213,,,,"Oh, so it's nostalgic for you. Personally, I wouldn't spend more money on something I already have.",,,,,,,,,
213,,,,I'll buy it for you! Problem solved.,,,,,,,,,
213,,,,"That's not… It's fine, I'll sleep on it and come back tomorrow.",,,,,,,,,
214,,,,"Sorry Raika, we took a wrong turn…",,,,,,,,,
214,,,,"And we found a bunch of super cool people!! Like, super hardcore singer guys!!",,,,,,,,,
214,,,,Hardcore singer guys…' Oh! Do you mean Vivid Street?,,,,,,,,,
214,,,,"Uh, I think that's right. It was. vivid.",,,,,,,,,
214,,,,"I always like hosting musicians from there, I can trust that they take their music seriously. So, how was it?",,,,,,,,,
214,,,,"Well, Mayuko tried to cheer some street singers on, and we ended up getting challenged? For something…?",,,,,,,,,
214,,,,And then Hiroshi dragged me away before I could join!! I wanted to do karaoke. ,,,,,,,,,
214,,,,They don't just do karaoke in Vivid Street. They were probably in a battle. ,,,,,,,,,
214,,,,"A battle..? Wait, we're not in trouble for interrupting, right? ",,,,,,,,,
214,,,,"You're fine. They probably realized you were newcomers, and wanted to scare you off. ",,,,,,,,,
214,,,,"I wasn't scared. Let's go back, I'll show them what I can do!",,,,,,,,,
214,,,,"Yeah, let's go back and get our asses handed to us. Great way to spend our afternoon. ",,,,,,,,,
214,,,,"Come on, let's just go find Yurina.",,,,,,,,,
215,,,,"Hey hey, Raika, you think you can VJ for us outside of VISR?",,,,,,,,,
215,,,,We haven't finished planning any sets… We're not getting any calls outside of VISR yet.,,,,,,,,,
215,,,,"Yeah, but it's good to ask in advance, right? ",,,,,,,,,
215,,,,"I'd be happy to help with visuals while you're performing in VISR, but I can't promise anything outside of that.",,,,,,,,,
215,,,,"…Honestly, Mayuko, I'm an amateur VJ. It's just not something I'm focused on when I have to manage the venue.",,,,,,,,,
215,,,,That makes sense. It's a lot of setup for what's basically a side-gig. ,,,,,,,,,
215,,,,"Mhm. I figured I could help bands achieve their vision for a performance, so I learned the basics. But you're better off finding someone else.",,,,,,,,,
215,,,,Aww... but I wanted Raika…,,,,,,,,,
215,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
215,,,,"We'll think about it later, okay?",,,,,,,,,
216,,,,"Okay, back. Sorry for ditching like that.",,,,,,,,,
216,,,,What was going on with that girl? Was she lost?,,,,,,,,,
216,,,,"Yeah, she got separated from her group, and her phone was dead. Good thing they weren't far. ",,,,,,,,,
216,,,,"Still, you should be careful about lending your phone out like that. She could've snatched it and ran.",,,,,,,,,
216,,,,"Raika, that's so cold. Besides, it's a good opportunity!",,,,,,,,,
216,,,,Opportunity for what?,,,,,,,,,
216,,,,"To advertise! You said that we should be putting ourselves out there, right? You should've invited her to our set.",,,,,,,,,
216,,,,You both need to get your priorities straight. ,,,,,,,,,
217,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
217,,,,"Look, I'm sorry…",,,,,,,,,
217,,,,"Not cool, Yurina. I was waiting forever for you to show up!",,,,,,,,,
217,,,,I have to prepare the stage for tonight. I can't let you two use VISR right now.,,,,,,,,,
217,,,,"Ah… Sorry. Honestly. Something came up, and I had to meet with someone to clear things up…",,,,,,,,,
217,,,,Hmph.,,,,,,,,,
217,,,,"Just figure it out, you two. If you're going to use VISR, I need to know in advance.",,,,,,,,,
217,,,,"Mayuko, is Sunday good? Same time?",,,,,,,,,
217,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
217,,,,Okay! If Raika's okay with it.,,,,,,,,,
217,,,,That should be fine. I'll mark it down.,,,,,,,,,
217,,,,Yayyyyy~ Practice is on again~ Thank you Yurina~,,,,,,,,,
217,,,,"Why are you thanking me? I was the one who — Actually, nevermind.",,,,,,,,,
218,,,,"Yurina, Raika, look! They were having a sale! Take one!",,,,,,,,,
218,,,,"Oh, cheese puffs. Thanks, Mayuko.",,,,,,,,,
218,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
218,,,,"Yurina, seriously? Mayuko went out of her way to buy some for you. Just take them.",,,,,,,,,
218,,,,"Yeah, no, sorry Mayuko. I'll pass. I can't stand this brand.",,,,,,,,,
218,,,,Huh? You sure?,,,,,,,,,
218,,,,"Positive. They're like, way too sweet.",,,,,,,,,
218,,,,? Did I get a bad batch?,,,,,,,,,
218,,,,"Don't take it to heart, Mayuko. Yurina has a… unique taste in snacks.",,,,,,,,,
218,,,,You really want to start this again? I'm literally normal. It's the rest of you who are crazy. ,,,,,,,,,
218,,,,It's not even sweet. It's a normal flavor. What's not normal is expecting them to be *savoury*.,,,,,,,,,
218,,,,Oh my god. I'm not taking this from you. You take everything but your coffee obnoxiously sweet.,,,,,,,,,
218,,,,"Uh… It's fine, you two, really! I'll just give the extra bag to Hiroshi.",,,,,,,,,
219,,,,That was fun~ I even got something for Hiroshi~,,,,,,,,,
219,,,,"Raika, you should've let me buy you something! You're always dressed so boring.",,,,,,,,,
219,,,,"I just don't see a point in buying anything fancy, is all. I'm working behind the scenes, so no one's going to see me. ",,,,,,,,,
219,,,,"Well, yeah, but what about for when you go out?",,,,,,,,,
219,,,,I don't do that.,,,,,,,,,
219,,,,"Hehe. I don't think this kind of fashion is her style, anyway. She's more about sweaters and all that cozy stuff.",,,,,,,,,
219,,,,"Bet! Raika, I'll find you something you like. ",,,,,,,,,
219,,,,"Damn it… Mayuko, seriously, save your money. ",,,,,,,,,
220,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
220,,,,Rai~ka! Found you!,,,,,,,,,
220,,,,—!,,,,,,,,,
220,,,,"Mayuko, how did you— ",,,,,,,,,
220,,,,"Miku likes to hide here and watch us practice, so I thought I'd say hi! Didn't think you'd be here, though.",,,,,,,,,
220,,,,Please ignore me. I'm just here to make sure nothing bad happens. I don't trust this place not to fall apart on us.,,,,,,,,,
220,,,,You sure? I can let Yurina know if you need something.,,,,,,,,,
220,,,,"Ghh, don't tell her I'm here. She'll make a big deal of it.",,,,,,,,,
220,,,,"You know what, nevermind. I'll take my leave. Have fun practicing, Mayuko.",,,,,,,,,
220,,,,?,,,,,,,,,
220,,,,"Mayuko, did something happen? You've been here for a while.",,,,,,,,,
220,,,,Oh… it's nothing! Let's just get back to practice! ,,,,,,,,,
221,,,,"You know, you don't need to be so tense. We're not gonna bite.",,,,,,,,,
221,,,,…Sorry. It's just. Weird. ,,,,,,,,,
221,,,,Eating lunch is weird? ,,,,,,,,,
221,,,,Seeing you two outside of VISR. I forgot you're just a year older than me. ,,,,,,,,,
221,,,,"Raika, you hear that? He's calling you old.",,,,,,,,,
221,,,,Not like that—!,,,,,,,,,
221,,,,"Yurina, be nice. And we're in the same grade, that makes you old, too.",,,,,,,,,
221,,,,Thank god for that. I can't wait to be 18. Actual freedom. ,,,,,,,,,
221,,,,"Adulthood isn't that simple, you know. ",,,,,,,,,
221,,,,Ugh… forget I brought this up. I don't want to think about all that.,,,,,,,,,
222,,,,"Yeah no, I used to annoy the hell out of Raika when we were in middle school.",,,,,,,,,
222,,,,"Like, we were in the same class, so I thought I'd get to know her by hanging out at VISR...",,,,,,,,,
222,,,,"But looking back, I was coming on way too hard.",,,,,,,,,
222,,,,"You're being too hard on yourself. I figured you were trying to be friendly, anyway, so I didn't mind. ",,,,,,,,,
222,,,,Really? I thought you gave me all those chores so I'd buzz off.,,,,,,,,,
222,,,,I'm not that cruel.,,,,,,,,,
222,,,,"Honestly, that sounds familiar…",,,,,,,,,
222,,,,"When we first met, Mayuko and I exchanged LINEs, and not even a day after, she was trying to buy us tickets to go to some livehouse. I barely got to recover from the day before.",,,,,,,,,
222,,,,"Aww, see, that's some good fun! Raika's idea of fun is making me do unpaid labor. ",,,,,,,,,
222,,,,Consider it payback for all the time you've broken my locks. ,,,,,,,,,
222,,,,(…I think I prefer Mayuko to whatever this is.),,,,,,,,,
223,,,,"You got what you needed, Hiroshi?",,,,,,,,,
223,,,,"Mhm, thanks for waiting.",,,,,,,,,
223,,,,"Not sure why you two wanted to wait outside the store, though. You sure you don't want to look around?",,,,,,,,,
223,,,,"Ahaha, I'm good. I don't think they'd be too happy to see me.",,,,,,,,,
223,,,,"..? What, did you rob them or something?",,,,,,,,,
223,,,,"Not these guys specifically… but yeah, close enough.",,,,,,,,,
223,,,,Wait. For real?!?!,,,,,,,,,
223,,,,"You're making it sound worse than it was, Yurina. It was a misunderstanding. ",,,,,,,,,
223,,,,"I mean, why try and sugarcoat it? I broke into a livehouse. People talked. They don't like me.",,,,,,,,,
223,,,,You aren't changing anyone's minds with an attitude like that…,,,,,,,,,
223,,,,"Nevermind, we'll talk later. Sorry for the trouble, Hiroshi.",,,,,,,,,
223,,,,"Uh… yeah, no problem.",,,,,,,,,
223,,,,"(Seriously, what kind of history do these guys have…)",,,,,,,,,
224,,,,"Hiroshi, is that your synthesizer?",,,,,,,,,
224,,,,"Ooh, that's a pretty instrument you got. Looks kinda old, though.",,,,,,,,,
224,,,,It's not mine. I found it in one of the closets here.,,,,,,,,,
224,,,,"Here, take a look. I don't know how SEKAI works, but if I'm right, this is an insane pull.",,,,,,,,,
224,,,,Really?,,,,,,,,,
224,,,,"Really!!! I can't believe Miku would just shove this in the back. One of the greats of polysynths, just sitting in one of her closets!",,,,,,,,,
224,,,,…I'm kinda too scared to touch it.,,,,,,,,,
224,,,,"Well, this is a first. I've never seen you this excited. Now I wanna hear its sound myself. ",,,,,,,,,
224,,,,I'm curious as well. Can we help you set it up? ,,,,,,,,,
224,,,,"Oh, uh, actually… that would be nice. Thanks, you two.",,,,,,,,,
225,,,,Kaori's out today…,,,,,,,,,
225,,,,That's a shame. I needed to ask about adjusting her outfit. ,,,,,,,,,
225,,,,Really? I thought everything was finalized.,,,,,,,,,
225,,,,Chiyomi was thinking about removing the line of spikes under the arms here. It might be uncomfortable for her if we're going with hard plastic.,,,,,,,,,
225,,,,"Oh, I see. In the show it looks cool, but if you actually keep your hands at your side, it'll poke you. ",,,,,,,,,
225,,,,"It's either that, or we make it out of something softer. I'm just worried about it wearing down. ",,,,,,,,,
225,,,,"It shouldn't really matter, right? It's not like she's wearing it regularly, or running marathons in it.",,,,,,,,,
225,,,,"Still, I'm leaving it up to her. Let's get in the classroom before a teacher sees us.",,,,,,,,,
226,,,,I can't believe you two.,,,,,,,,,
226,,,,Sorry!! I didn't realize you got lost in the crowd!!,,,,,,,,,
226,,,,I can't be *that* easy to lose.,,,,,,,,,
226,,,,I mean… you are pretty short…,,,,,,,,,
226,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
226,,,,Sorry…,,,,,,,,,
226,,,,It's fine... Maybe I should invest in some heels. ,,,,,,,,,
226,,,,"Those are such a pain to walk in, though. You're fine as is, Koharu.",,,,,,,,,
226,,,,I know I'm fine as is. But I need to survive in public somehow. ,,,,,,,,,
226,,,,"Come on, let's just cross before the light turns red.",,,,,,,,,
227,,,,"That was really fun, actually. I had no idea they held markets here. Thanks for bringing me along.",,,,,,,,,
227,,,,"Of course! There's usually something going on here, it's great if you want something to do for cheap.",,,,,,,,,
227,,,,Mhm. And the park's big enough that you can avoid the crowds if you want. There's some nice quiet spots if you search for it.,,,,,,,,,
227,,,,Why you would come all the way out here to wallow is what I don't get. ,,,,,,,,,
227,,,,See! They even have an obstacle course! You can't feel sad doing an obstacle course.,,,,,,,,,
227,,,,Ergh… ,,,,,,,,,
227,,,,"Well, maybe you could. ",,,,,,,,,
228,,,,"Seriously, where on earth is she?",,,,,,,,,
228,,,,"Chiyomi, you sure Kaori's in SEKAI?",,,,,,,,,
228,,,,"I mean, she told me she was going to be in here, and her backpack's still at the stage….",,,,,,,,,
228,,,,We've searched all over the grounds. Don't tell me she went inside the academy. She has no reason to wander that far.,,,,,,,,,
228,,,,"That, or she's gotten in trouble with MEIKO…",,,,,,,,,
228,,,,I don't think that's the case. Miku would be kicking up a storm if that happened. ,,,,,,,,,
228,,,,Let's just find a way inside. Maybe Miku'll know what's going on with her.,,,,,,,,,
229,,,,…How long is Sanae gonna stay hidden? It's not like they know she's here.,,,,,,,,,
229,,,,She told me she waits 5 minutes afterwards to be safe. Sometimes she moves around if she thinks the teachers' already been somewhere.,,,,,,,,,
229,,,,She's actually insane. She's lucky there isn't a warrant on her.,,,,,,,,,
229,,,,"Maybe we should help her out. If we create a distraction, she can sneak in with all the noise. ",,,,,,,,,
229,,,,You just want to cause trouble.,,,,,,,,,
229,,,,"Koharu, since you're such a good student, why don't you help me out? You can be the bait.",,,,,,,,,
229,,,,You just want to get *me* in trouble!,,,,,,,,,
229,,,,I can be the bait. I'd be such good bait. ,,,,,,,,,
229,,,,"…Oh, nevermind, Sanae's back. Maybe next time, Chiyomi.",,,,,,,,,
230,,,,Should we just go inside without her?,,,,,,,,,
230,,,,"No, too risky… If Sanae gets caught, it's easier to say she was with one of us.",,,,,,,,,
230,,,,"Oh yeah, I remember. When we first met, I had to bail her out cuz she almost got caught trying to sneak in. ",,,,,,,,,
230,,,,"Yeah, she basically owes me her life~ ",,,,,,,,,
230,,,,Don't be weird. Why would you help a stranger sneak into the school? What if she was dangerous?,,,,,,,,,
230,,,,"I was bored, and it looked like something interesting was happening. And it was, wasn't it? Everything's gotten so exciting since we found SEKAI.",,,,,,,,,
230,,,,"It has! I mean, even without the SEKAI…",,,,,,,,,
230,,,,I'm happy we get to hang out like this.,,,,,,,,,
230,,,,I guess I can't be mad about that. ,,,,,,,,,
231,,,,"Kaori, this CD, is this from your old group..?",,,,,,,,,
231,,,,?! Why are they still selling those? This version is super old. ,,,,,,,,,
231,,,,"I mean, I know the media can't get enough of me, but that's ridiculous. ",,,,,,,,,
231,,,,Maybe they're trying to get rid of deadstock?,,,,,,,,,
231,,,,"In that case, I think I'll buy it. I want to see how great your singing was 3 years ago.",,,,,,,,,
231,,,,"Sure, go for it.",,,,,,,,,
231,,,,…You don't care?,,,,,,,,,
231,,,,"What, you think I'm embarrassed? I'm a trained professional, Koharu. It's not the same as your karoake sessions as a kid.",,,,,,,,,
231,,,,"—! I'll have you know, I did not have those.",,,,,,,,,
231,,,,"Hehe. Koharu, when you're done, let me borrow it. I'd also like to listen.",,,,,,,,,
232,,,,Thanks for coming along. I almost forgot to pick up the birdfeed before I went home.,,,,,,,,,
232,,,,I hope you had fun.,,,,,,,,,
232,,,,Of course! I loved the kittens. I wish I could've taken them all home…,,,,,,,,,
232,,,,"You can't become a crazy cat lady yet, Koharu. You're only 16. At least wait a decade or two.",,,,,,,,,
232,,,,Ha ha ha. You liked them too. The little grey one loved you.,,,,,,,,,
232,,,,"Hehe, that's nice… A cat sounds nice, but I don't know if it'll work with my mom's budgies. ",,,,,,,,,
232,,,,"Oh, right. That could go really bad.",,,,,,,,,
232,,,,"But budgies are cute, too. Do they know any tricks? ",,,,,,,,,
232,,,,"Oooh, you should teach them recall. Imagine how cool you'd look walking around the city with a bird on your shoulder.",,,,,,,,,
232,,,,I don't think my mom would let me risk that… ,,,,,,,,,
232,,,,"Sad. Well, you can get a pigeon off the street and try it on that.",,,,,,,,,
232,,,,Don't go around grabbing random birds. That's just unsanitary.,,,,,,,,,
232,,,,...,,,,,,,,,
232,,,,"— Chiyomi, don't tell me you're considering it…",,,,,,,,,
233,,,,What on earth…,,,,,,,,,
233,,,,"Psst, Koharu, get out of the way!!!",,,,,,,,,
233,,,,???????,,,,,,,,,
233,,,,??? What are you two doing in the hedges?,,,,,,,,,
233,,,,Trying to lure in MEIKO. ,,,,,,,,,
233,,,,"Are you serious? A box trap? She's a Virtual Singer, not a cat.",,,,,,,,,
233,,,,And what is this bait? Did you uproot a bunch of her flowers from the garden?! She's going to kill you.,,,,,,,,,
233,,,,"No, we got them from outside… But she doesn't need to know that.",,,,,,,,,
233,,,,Now get in here. Or do you want her to catch you next to her precious flowers?,,,,,,,,,
233,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
233,,,,All these branches are going to ruin my skirt.,,,,,,,,,
233,,,,"Oh my god, you'll live.",,,,,,,,,
234,,,,How crazy would it be if we tried to have our club meeting on the roof?,,,,,,,,,
234,,,,Too crazy. You're already pushing it with sneaking into the classroom. ,,,,,,,,,
234,,,,"Yeah, sorry Sanae, we'd probably get caught. ",,,,,,,,,
234,,,,"I think there's some school idols who practice up there afterschool, so we couldn't go even if we wanted to.",,,,,,,,,
234,,,,"Oh, right. MORE MORE JUMP! used to use this school's rooftop. And they've made it super big, so it must be holy ground for you guys.",,,,,,,,,
234,,,,"That's about right. It must be nice for them, knowing they inspired so many people…",,,,,,,,,
234,,,,*Sigh* I wish they'd be inspired somewhere else. We can't really practice our routine in the classroom. Unless we move the desks around more?,,,,,,,,,
234,,,,We'd have to push the desks out of the classroom to have enough room. Just be grateful for the space we have.,,,,,,,,,
235,,,,"Are you sure you'll be able to pick up your sisters in time? It's getting late, and we walked most of the way here…",,,,,,,,,
235,,,,"Sure I will! I'll just run the rest of the way back, no big deal.",,,,,,,,,
235,,,,Besides! I can't let you two walk home alone either. I should at least go with you halfway.,,,,,,,,,
235,,,,"Sure you can. You don't need to worry about us, we're not getting snatched off the street.",,,,,,,,,
235,,,,"Well, Koharu won't be. But I haven't been kidnapped since I was 13, so you don't need to worry~",,,,,,,,,
235,,,,Wait— really?!,,,,,,,,,
235,,,,Kaori's messing around. She's not that important to get kidnapped. ,,,,,,,,,
235,,,,"Anyway, as long as you're not making them wait for long, I don't mind. Maybe we should use the underground passage next time.",,,,,,,,,
236,,,,(What's Koharu doing in that alleyway..?),,,,,,,,,
236,,,,O'Malley? Are you here..?,,,,,,,,,
236,,,,Kittyyyyy? Pspspspspsps?,,,,,,,,,
236,,,,Meow~,,,,,,,,,
236,,,,—GAH!,,,,,,,,,
236,,,,KAORI!!!!!,,,,,,,,,
236,,,,"HA, you should see yourself right now. You're beet-red. ",,,,,,,,,
236,,,,Shut up!!!! ,,,,,,,,,
236,,,,"Kaori, stop that!! Koharu was just— uh, actually, Koharu, what were you doing?",,,,,,,,,
236,,,,Ugh… I was looking for a cat.,,,,,,,,,
236,,,,"He's this big, ginger tom, and he's usually around this alley. I named him O'Malley.",,,,,,,,,
236,,,,"Oh, like that one cat movie. Now I want to see this O'Malley in the flesh. ",,,,,,,,,
236,,,,"Are you sure he's a stray? If he's not here, he might've gone back home to his family.",,,,,,,,,
236,,,,I hope not… I would've liked to adopt him one day…,,,,,,,,,
236,,,,You hope that he's homeless? That's cold. ,,,,,,,,,
236,,,,"—I'm kidding, I'm kidding! I don't see any gingers around, anyway. Let's get out of this place. ",,,,,,,,,
237,,,,What kind of shopping trip is this? We've barely bought anything. You've just been dragging us from store to store.,,,,,,,,,
237,,,,"Because this isn't a shopping trip. We're buying clothes to repurpose, and we need to be smart about it.",,,,,,,,,
237,,,,You're being cheap about it. That dress would've been perfect with some adjustments. I have the allowance.,,,,,,,,,
237,,,,As if I'm going to let you spend that much. I could make something as simple as that.,,,,,,,,,
237,,,,Maybe at the cost of your *sanity*.,,,,,,,,,
237,,,,Where's Sanae? Let's ask her what she thinks—,,,,,,,,,
237,,,,"Ok, I'm back!! Look what I got!!",,,,,,,,,
237,,,,…These are friendship charms.,,,,,,,,,
237,,,,"Super cute, right? Here, Koharu, the apple is yours. And Kaori, you get the pony. I got the butterfly for Chiyomi, and the sunflower's mine!",,,,,,,,,
237,,,,"Hell yeah, this is more like it. Thanks, I'm gonna keep it on my backpack.",,,,,,,,,
237,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
237,,,,"Wait, Koharu, did you want a different one?",,,,,,,,,
237,,,,"No, no, these are cute. Thanks, Sanae.",,,,,,,,,
238,,,,"Y'know, it's always super sunny and nice in here. I wonder if it ever rains?",,,,,,,,,
238,,,,"The outdoor stage doesn't have a roof or anything, so it would suck if we couldn't practice in here.",,,,,,,,,
238,,,,"I mean, there's always the academy itself. We could just go in there.",,,,,,,,,
238,,,,"Yeah, but that feels wrong. Most of the time we're out here. I dunno how you sneak in there so often.",,,,,,,,,
238,,,,I think we have bigger concerns than the weather. ,,,,,,,,,
238,,,,*BOOM*,,,,,,,,,
238,,,,…Good point.,,,,,,,,,
238,,,,"Yeah, let's just meet up at the park. I'll let Chiyomi know.",,,,,,,,,
239,,,,Koharu *skipped school???*,,,,,,,,,
239,,,,No way. Are you sure?? Maybe she's sick? Or she had an emergency?,,,,,,,,,
239,,,,"Oh, I got it. She got kidnapped, and now she's being held for ransom. Did you check for any coded messages?",,,,,,,,,
239,,,,"No, I'm sure. I asked one of her classmates. Apparently she skips gym a lot, and they had a physical exam today.",,,,,,,,,
239,,,,…Huh. And she gets on *my* case for leaving early all the time.,,,,,,,,,
239,,,,"At least she's not kidnapped. I knew she hated gym, but that's extreme. You know if she's still coming? ",,,,,,,,,
239,,,,"No, sorry… She didn't reply to my texts, so…",,,,,,,,,
239,,,,That's fine. I just hope she's not in trouble…,,,,,,,,,
240,,,,"So you two known each other for a while, huh…",,,,,,,,,
240,,,,"Yep! Since primary school. We were in the same class, so it just kinda happened.",,,,,,,,,
240,,,,"Aw, that's sweet. I didn't talk much to people in primary school, I think most of my friends are from junior high.",,,,,,,,,
240,,,,"Honestly, me neither… but we saw each other a lot outside of school, so that helped.",,,,,,,,,
240,,,,What about your work? Are you friends with the rest of your group?,,,,,,,,,
240,,,,…Eh.,,,,,,,,,
240,,,,Really?,,,,,,,,,
240,,,,"I'm friendly enough. Hard to make actual friends when you effortlessly outshine everyone, though. You know how it is.",,,,,,,,,
240,,,,"Not really… But I mean, I don't know what the industry's like, so…",,,,,,,,,
241,,,,"Oh wow, they have a lot of Lovcure stuff here… I don't recognize half of it.",,,,,,,,,
241,,,,"Probably from the previous seasons. It's been going on since before any of us were born, so they got lots to choose from.",,,,,,,,,
241,,,,"Man, now I have no idea what to get for the girls. Chiyomi, what do you think?",,,,,,,,,
241,,,,I don't know… Can't you just ask them..?,,,,,,,,,
241,,,,"But then it won't be a surprise!! Okay, just tell me what you *would* want if I was buying you something.",,,,,,,,,
241,,,,PG RZ-78 2.,,,,,,,,,
241,,,,…Huh? What season is that from?!,,,,,,,,,
241,,,,"She's talking about model kits, Sanae. I don't think these are her style, anyway.",,,,,,,,,
241,,,,Fair enough. I'll just ask the girls when I pick them up.,,,,,,,,,
242,,,,Sorry… ,,,,,,,,,
242,,,,"No, it's nothing to apologize for!!! We'll get there, we just gotta keep working at it!!",,,,,,,,,
242,,,,I don't think I'll ever get it down… I'm just bad at this.,,,,,,,,,
242,,,,No need to be a downer about it. Everyone mixes up their left and right sometimes.,,,,,,,,,
242,,,,"Y'know, one of my groupmates would do something… Whenever she was practicing, she'd paint her nails on one hand a certain color, so she didn't have to think too hard about which direction was which.",,,,,,,,,
242,,,,"And mirrors confused her, so she'd film herself from the back. She said it helped her map her movements better. ",,,,,,,,,
242,,,,You think that'll help?,,,,,,,,,
242,,,,"I'll try it. I can't say how well it'll go, though…",,,,,,,,,
242,,,,Give it a shot! We'll just try again tomorrow.,,,,,,,,,
243,,,,"Here you go, Toshi! Gift for you~",,,,,,,,,
243,,,,?… What is this for?,,,,,,,,,
243,,,,"Ever since we started hanging out, the disciplinary committee's been leaving me alone about my uniform! I owe you one~",,,,,,,,,
243,,,,"Wait, Toshiki has connections?! That's so cool! ",,,,,,,,,
243,,,,"Yeah!! With this one upperclassman, anyway. She's on the student council too, so she's like, SUPER high rank. ",,,,,,,,,
243,,,,H… huh? I'm not sure what you mean… ,,,,,,,,,
243,,,,"Oh, wait. Do you mean Sanae?",,,,,,,,,
243,,,,"You don't know who I'm talking about? Isn't she, like, your sister??",,,,,,,,,
243,,,,"I know she has a lot of work afterschool, but I'm not aware of the specifics…",,,,,,,,,
243,,,,Geez. You're SERIOUSLY out of the loop. At least Keishi's new and has an excuse.,,,,,,,,,
243,,,,"Wait, I don't want to be out of the loop! Who else is on the council? Anyone I should know?",,,,,,,,,
243,,,,"See, THAT'S the attitude you gotta have if you wanna to survive! Pay attention, we're having a lesson on the Kamiyama social hierarchy!",,,,,,,,,
243,,,,(You make it sound as if we're in some kind of high school drama…),,,,,,,,,
244,,,,"Keishi, you ever thought of reviewing the cafeteria food on your blog? ",,,,,,,,,
244,,,,"Um, I've considered it… But, I mean, it's just school food. I can't really post about that.",,,,,,,,,
244,,,,Boo. They could use your opinions. They're SUPER inconsistant. It's like they flip a coin each morning to decide whether or not to spice the curry.,,,,,,,,,
244,,,,Really? I hate it when its spicy. It's feels like they're trying to cover up the lack of flavor.,,,,,,,,,
244,,,,I think it tastes fine…,,,,,,,,,
244,,,,"Toshi, you eat omelets everyday. You just don't have the taste bud capacity to know this stuff.",,,,,,,,,
244,,,,Oh. ,,,,,,,,,
244,,,,B-but it's not like we can't change that! It's just about expanding your palette. We should all go out and eat somewhere!,,,,,,,,,
244,,,,"Toshiki, do you have any preferences? ",,,,,,,,,
244,,,,Not that I can think of… I'm open to anything you have to offer.,,,,,,,,,
244,,,,"OOOH, actually, I know the PERFECT place!!",,,,,,,,,
244,,,,"Toshi, how about some yakiniku? I know a place that'll CHANGE you as a PERSON!!!",,,,,,,,,
244,,,,"…Uh, or maybe something less intense? He's looking kinda scared. ",,,,,,,,,
244,,,,"…No, that's alright. If Ami says it's good, then I'm looking forward to it.",,,,,,,,,
244,,,,"YIPPEE!! I'll tell Rion when she gets back, and we'll make it a date!",,,,,,,,,
245,,,,"Ami, at least tell us before you go off…",,,,,,,,,
245,,,,Sorry!!! But there was these really cute phone accessories at that shop!!!,,,,,,,,,
245,,,,Do you have any room left on your case..? It's already so crowded.,,,,,,,,,
245,,,,"OBVIOUSLY, I wasn't gonna stick it on this one. It doesn't even match with the aesthetic! Keep up, Keishi.",,,,,,,,,
245,,,,"— Wait, where's Toshiki?!",,,,,,,,,
245,,,,Oh no…,,,,,,,,,
245,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
245,,,,Toshi!!!! Stop running away!!!!!!,,,,,,,,,
245,,,,Oh. When did you two walk off..?,,,,,,,,,
245,,,,Don't pin this on me!! You're the one who stayed behind!!!!!,,,,,,,,,
245,,,,Maybe we should all just hold hands and walk…  ,,,,,,,,,
246,,,,Why are we doing this..?,,,,,,,,,
246,,,,"Because Miku's being cryptic about how far SEKAI goes, and I. want. answers!!!! Keishi, tie this end to the statue's base.",,,,,,,,,
246,,,,On it!,,,,,,,,,
246,,,,And this end of the rope will be ours! So everyone just stay behind me!,,,,,,,,,
246,,,,"But… Miku said something could find us, if we go too far… ",,,,,,,,,
246,,,,"W-wait, hold on, she said that?!",,,,,,,,,
246,,,,"Toshi, she was totally messing with us. She was probably talking about Luka, or something.",,,,,,,,,
246,,,,"And anyway!!! If we pause Untitled, we should be fine. So no chickening out!!!",,,,,,,,,
246,,,,Um… okay! If you say so.,,,,,,,,,
246,,,,"THAT'S what I wanna hear! Now, ONWARDS! ",,,,,,,,,
246,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
246,,,,(The knot came undone…),,,,,,,,,
246,,,,(I'll just stay here and hold onto this end.),,,,,,,,,
247,,,,"Come on!!! ONE of us has to be smart enough to get this. It's supposed to be, like, a 33% chance. ",,,,,,,,,
247,,,,Where are you getting this number from?,,,,,,,,,
247,,,,"There's three of us. 33%, 66%, 99%. Keishi's not here, so he can be the 1%.",,,,,,,,,
247,,,,"Oh. Actually, Keishiro's good about studying. He was teaching me about derivatives the other day cuz I missed the lesson. ",,,,,,,,,
247,,,,Go ask with him if you're confused on this problem. I'm no good at tutoring people.,,,,,,,,,
247,,,,But you tutored Toshi all the time. Are you SURE none of that transfers over?,,,,,,,,,
247,,,,It was only for violin… and we didn't end up doing any proper practice…,,,,,,,,,
247,,,,Boo. How am I supposed to keep honor roll like this?,,,,,,,,,
247,,,,???? You're on honor roll?? ,,,,,,,,,
247,,,,"Ami, that makes *you* the smart one. If anything, you should be tutoring *us.*",,,,,,,,,
247,,,,"…Ok, fine, you caught me…",,,,,,,,,
247,,,,"But I REALLY don't understand this!!!!! I need ALL HANDS ON DECK here, people!!!!!!!!",,,,,,,,,
247,,,,I can't say I'll be much help… But I'll try my hand at it.,,,,,,,,,
248,,,,I don't get why you keep showing up for brass band. None of us go there anymore.,,,,,,,,,
248,,,,? Do you think the director cares if my friends aren't in the club anymore? I still have to show up and help. Kinda the entire point.,,,,,,,,,
248,,,,"Seriously? What, for the whole year?",,,,,,,,,
248,,,,*Yes.* Can we drop it?,,,,,,,,,
248,,,,Maybe I should ask to rejoin. If it keeps you company…,,,,,,,,,
248,,,,"God, no, you don't need to do that. Besides, the director won't let you. ",,,,,,,,,
248,,,,"Yeah, he'll totally get on our case about being wishy-washy. ",,,,,,,,,
248,,,,*sigh* How I miss the good old days of one week ago… ,,,,,,,,,
248,,,,Are you sure you don't just miss causing trouble..?,,,,,,,,,
248,,,,Toshi!!!! So mean!!!!!!! ,,,,,,,,,
248,,,,"Anyway, I don't miss it THAT much. What we have is, like, WAY better~",,,,,,,,,
248,,,,…Yeah. I like this too.,,,,,,,,,
249,,,,Should I cut my hair?,,,,,,,,,
249,,,,Huh?,,,,,,,,,
249,,,,"Where's this coming from? I mean, if you really want to—",,,,,,,,,
249,,,,NO!!!! NO NO NO NOOOOO!!! Don't! do! it!!! ,,,,,,,,,
249,,,,Oh.,,,,,,,,,
249,,,,"Ami, calm down. It's his hair, he can do what he wants with it. ",,,,,,,,,
249,,,,"I know, but that takes FOREVER to grow!! And he can style it in so many ways!! You can't do that if you buzz it all off!!",,,,,,,,,
249,,,,I wasn't planning on buzzing it…,,,,,,,,,
249,,,,"…I don't think I want to cut it, anyway. I just thought I should, now that I'm in high school.",,,,,,,,,
249,,,,"Ok well, don't do anything you don't want to do. ",,,,,,,,,
249,,,,"Ami's right, you can always just style it some other way.",,,,,,,,,
249,,,,"Toshiki, when you're ready, come to me! I'll do you WAY better than any old hairdresser.",,,,,,,,,
249,,,,Ok. Thank you.,,,,,,,,,
250,,,,"Ami, have you seen Rion?",,,,,,,,,
250,,,,No? Didn't you see her in class?,,,,,,,,,
250,,,,"She showed up to school, but then left around English… I'm going to go look for her.",,,,,,,,,
250,,,,"You sure she isn't like, sick or something? Maybe she went home early?",,,,,,,,,
250,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
250,,,,"…Yeah, probably not. ",,,,,,,,,
250,,,,"Lemme come with you, though! I don't wanna have lunch outside, anyway.",,,,,,,,,
250,,,,Geez. Can't even skip in peace.,,,,,,,,,
250,,,,!!!,,,,,,,,,
250,,,,RION!!!! You need to tell us BEFORE you disappear like that!!! You know how LAME I look sitting alone at lunch. ,,,,,,,,,
250,,,,"Yeah, yeah. Sorry. I just didn't want to deal with this teacher.",,,,,,,,,
250,,,,You guys gonna have lunch here?,,,,,,,,,
250,,,,"If you don't mind. I also have the notes from class, if you want them.",,,,,,,,,
250,,,,You really don't have to… I was gonna come back after lunch. ,,,,,,,,,
250,,,,"…Thanks, though. Let's sit down somewhere.",,,,,,,,,
251,,,,…The painting in this gallery…,,,,,,,,,
251,,,,What about it?,,,,,,,,,
251,,,,Oh. It's nothing.,,,,,,,,,
251,,,,I thought that it looked different the other day… But I must be imagining things.,,,,,,,,,
251,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
251,,,,"PSST, Rion, follow me!!!",,,,,,,,,
251,,,,Should we tell him?,,,,,,,,,
251,,,,"Obviously? What, are you saying we don't?",,,,,,,,,
251,,,,I mean!!! What if he spills?? Then that's Miku's experiment RUINED!,,,,,,,,,
251,,,,"Seriously, he's not a child, he knows how to keep his mouth shut. Have some faith. ",,,,,,,,,
251,,,,I can hear you two.,,,,,,,,,
251,,,,…Oh.,,,,,,,,,
251,,,,What is this about an experiment?,,,,,,,,,
251,,,,"Well, since you figured it out, I guess we can tell ya~ So basically…",,,,,,,,,
252,,,,…Too loud in there.,,,,,,,,,
252,,,,Too *noisy* in there.,,,,,,,,,
252,,,,Sorryyyy… I thought it would be a nice change of pace to eat in the music room…,,,,,,,,,
252,,,,It isn't your fault. It was nice of you to introduce us to your friends.,,,,,,,,,
252,,,,"Of course! I'm glad you guys got to meet them. Rion, you should've stuck around longer.",,,,,,,,,
252,,,,No thanks. I already know what they think of me.,,,,,,,,,
252,,,,Come on… They're nice…,,,,,,,,,
252,,,,It's just the truth.,,,,,,,,,
252,,,,"Whatever, I'm gonna go find Ami. Have fun, you two.",,,,,,,,,
253,,,,That was nice. I had no idea there was a pastry place down there. You'd think they'd try to stand out a bit more.,,,,,,,,,
253,,,,"Me neither… Though, I don't wander too far from this street anyway…",,,,,,,,,
253,,,,"Aw man, you two are missing out! There's some great food spots around here.",,,,,,,,,
253,,,,"Thanks for taking us. Though, what was with the photos? You got a secret Picshare or something? ",,,,,,,,,
253,,,,"Oh no, that was for my blog! I've written about this place before, but it was so long ago, so I think I'll do a followup piece.",,,,,,,,,
253,,,,Oh. So that's why you were interrogating us. ,,,,,,,,,
253,,,,I— Interrogating?!,,,,,,,,,
253,,,,"Uh, yeah? You were asking us a million questions about the interior and the flavor and all that. I thought you were just worried we wouldn't like it. ",,,,,,,,,
253,,,,Eek… I'm sorry… I thought I was being discrete…,,,,,,,,,
253,,,,I don't mind. It just means you take your blog seriously. I'd like to hear more of your recommendations. ,,,,,,,,,
253,,,,"Oh!! Ok then, if you really don't mind!!!",,,,,,,,,
254,,,,"Oh, what fancy clothes…!",,,,,,,,,
254,,,,These look like the type that Ami wears.,,,,,,,,,
254,,,,"Huh, you're right. They got a nice aesthetic going on here. Maybe this is where she gets her coords.",,,,,,,,,
254,,,,"Ahaha… I was just thinking about what we'd wear on stage. Some bands have matching outfits, so I thought…",,,,,,,,,
254,,,,"Ahh, I dunno if I can pull this off, though…",,,,,,,,,
254,,,,"Yeah, same here. I'd just look stupid.",,,,,,,,,
254,,,,I think it could be fun.,,,,,,,,,
254,,,,Really? Didn't think you were that bold. I don't think I'd seen you outside of sweater vests.,,,,,,,,,
254,,,,"Well, I like them… But it's good to try something new, isn't it? ",,,,,,,,,
254,,,,"I mean..! If Toshiki's willing to try it, maybe we should too?",,,,,,,,,
254,,,,We should ask Ami later! She might have an idea on how to get started. ,,,,,,,,,
255,,,,"Yeah, no, if you don't want your brothers to find out at all, that isn't gonna work. Even an electric drumkit's gonna make noise.",,,,,,,,,
255,,,,"Aww… I mean, I thought so, but I was still hoping…",,,,,,,,,
255,,,,I know how you feel. I had gotten an electric violin because I was told I could practice without disturbing others. ,,,,,,,,,
255,,,,"But it ended up being audible, anyway. So now, I just play outside.",,,,,,,,,
255,,,,Really? Man… At least your violin's portable!,,,,,,,,,
255,,,,That's not the only problem that violin gave you.,,,,,,,,,
255,,,,"I mean, it doesn't matter now. But if you were still in brass band, you'd be shooting yourself in the foot, using that for practice.",,,,,,,,,
255,,,,"…It's in the past. It works for what we have now, doesn't it?",,,,,,,,,
255,,,,"Yeah, true. Ami really is a lifesaver.",,,,,,,,,
255,,,,"Anyway, Keishiro, you can just practice in here. It's probably better for you, anyway.",,,,,,,,,
255,,,,"Yeah, good point… Thanks anyway.",,,,,,,,,
256,,,,Are you two trying to embarrass yourselves on purpose??,,,,,,,,,
256,,,,"Ok, in OUR defense, I didn't know it was possible to get kicked out of the library. How were we supposed to know that?",,,,,,,,,
256,,,,That's even *worse????* How do you even knock down an entire shelf like that?,,,,,,,,,
256,,,,"Sorry… We thought if we helped you put back the books, you'd get out faster…",,,,,,,,,
256,,,,But the stepladder thing wasn't my fault! I— I think one of the steps was broken… ,,,,,,,,,
256,,,,"Wait, seriously? That's what happened?",,,,,,,,,
256,,,,That's an actual safety hazard. Why didn't you tell them that? They would've understood if that was the story.,,,,,,,,,
256,,,,I WAS trying to tell them that!!! Maybe they should've LISTENED instead of bitching about my VOLUME!!,,,,,,,,,
256,,,,Sorry… I didn't want to cause trouble…,,,,,,,,,
256,,,,"Ugh… Keishiro, you're okay, right?",,,,,,,,,
256,,,,"Yeah, I'm fine…",,,,,,,,,
256,,,,That's good. Let's go back and tell them about the ladder. ,,,,,,,,,
256,,,,"Aren't we kicked out, though? ",,,,,,,,,
256,,,,We still need to make sure no one gets hurt. Come on. And keep it down this time.,,,,,,,,,
257,,,,"You're real excited to get this album, aren't you?",,,,,,,,,
257,,,,Really? Is it obvious..?,,,,,,,,,
257,,,,"You've been smiling to yourself this entire time. Yeah, it's obvious.",,,,,,,,,
257,,,,Ahaha… I've been saving up for this since they announced it. ,,,,,,,,,
257,,,,"Really?? Can you understand the lyrics? Are you, like, secretly super fluent in English?",,,,,,,,,
257,,,,"Not really… but, I mean, someone'll come out with a translation! I can wait.",,,,,,,,,
257,,,,"And anyway, they're always super creative with their composition. Language doesn't matter with production like this…",,,,,,,,,
257,,,,"Pssh, we have to practice English anyway, you're probably just gonna translate it yourself. ",,,,,,,,,
257,,,,"In that case, lemme borrow my parents' CDs. I'll put you on some REAL niche overseas music. ",,,,,,,,,
257,,,,"Oh, okay!!! Sounds fun!",,,,,,,,,
257,,,,"Seriously, Ami, it's not a competition. ",,,,,,,,,
257,,,,"I mean, duh. I'm just making sure he actually means all that stuff. ",,,,,,,,,
258,,,,Oh!! He's adorable!! His ears are so floppy.,,,,,,,,,
258,,,,"You have so many pictures of him, too. What did you say his name was?",,,,,,,,,
258,,,,Bonbon!!! Isn't he the cutest?!?,,,,,,,,,
258,,,,I wish you guys could actually meet him. He's just also so GRUMPY!!! I can't take him anywhere.,,,,,,,,,
258,,,,Grumpy..?,,,,,,,,,
258,,,,"YEAH!! He loves me, but he gets so mean with other bunnies. And when I take him outside in his carrier, he just thumps his foot all the time.",,,,,,,,,
258,,,,"You shouldn't bring him outside, anyway. Rabbits are delicate.",,,,,,,,,
258,,,,Pssh. He's not delicate at all. He bites my fingers if I don't give him his breakfast in time.,,,,,,,,,
258,,,,"Finger biting or not, he's still a prey animal. ",,,,,,,,,
258,,,,In that case… Maybe you can bring him to SEKAI? It's usually quiet there.,,,,,,,,,
258,,,,"OOOH, great idea!",,,,,,,,,
258,,,,"Bad idea. SEKAI stressed *me* out, a rabbit'll have no idea what's going on. ",,,,,,,,,
258,,,,"*sigh* Too bad… One day, though, I'm gonna introduce him to you guys!!!",,,,,,,,,
259,,,,How do you have *this many* vinyls?? Aren't these expensive? Is this some new hobby of yours?,,,,,,,,,
259,,,,"Obviously not. Shopping for coords is EXPENSIVE! I'd be, like, completely broke!",,,,,,,,,
259,,,,"Anyway, these aren't mine, they're my mom's!!! I wanted to show them off, since we have a record player now!",,,,,,,,,
259,,,,Really? Wow! She must've been a big fan of this artist… I can see where it's worn…,,,,,,,,,
259,,,,DON'T!!! TOUCH!!!!!! It's FRAGILE!!  ,,,,,,,,,
259,,,,"Sorry!!!! Sorry, here, take it back…",,,,,,,,,
259,,,,I'll do the honors~!,,,,,,,,,
259,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
259,,,,"…….AHHHHH, I'm scared!! What if this is like, a trap record player?? Can SEKAI do that???",,,,,,,,,
259,,,,Oh my god. I'll do it.,,,,,,,,,
259,,,,Rion—!,,,,,,,,,
259,,,,— ♪,,,,,,,,,
259,,,,"…Well, it wasn't a trap! Ok Keishi, you can pick the next one~",,,,,,,,,
260,,,,"Oh, I see her. Mayuko, over here!",,,,,,,,,
260,,,,"Hi~! Ok, I'm ready, let's go!",,,,,,,,,
260,,,,What the hell happened? You weren't replying to my messages either. Raika was about to have an fit.,,,,,,,,,
260,,,,"Aha, sorry… Some guy bumped into me and I lost my hat in the crowd. So I was looking for it.",,,,,,,,,
260,,,,At least send a message next time…,,,,,,,,,
260,,,,"Hold on, is that the same cap you're wearing right now? Don't wear that, it's probably been stepped on.",,,,,,,,,
260,,,,"Seriously, who do you take me for? I'm not gonna wear a hat that got trampled!!",,,,,,,,,
260,,,,"Obviously, this is my backup★",,,,,,,,,
260,,,,…Huh.,,,,,,,,,
260,,,,"Yeah, I figured. She has like, 5 of the same design.",,,,,,,,,
260,,,,"Hey, that's good. It means she has a brand. Everyone will know that you're a cool guy.",,,,,,,,,
260,,,,"Exactly! Finally, someone gets it~!",,,,,,,,,
260,,,,"Anyway, let's go already! We have to set up early for today.",,,,,,,,,
261,,,,How on earth are you eating that? It's 50% chocolate sauce and toppings.,,,,,,,,,
261,,,,The same way you're eating your parfait right now. ,,,,,,,,,
261,,,,"Yeah, but there's so *much.* You won't be able to enjoy the ice cream flavor like that.",,,,,,,,,
261,,,,"I know, how about you give me some of your chocolate pieces? It'll lighten the load.",,,,,,,,,
261,,,,"Geez… if you're still hungry, just take some of mine. All that sugar can't taste good, anyway.",,,,,,,,,
261,,,,Really? Thanks Hiro~,,,,,,,,,
261,,,,How am I the weird one here?? Yurina's literally eating hers with french fries.,,,,,,,,,
261,,,,*munch*,,,,,,,,,
261,,,,"Ok, but that's like, the least weird thing Yurina's done. ",,,,,,,,,
261,,,,"Excuse you, dipping fries in ice cream is a time-honored tradition. I'm honoring my roots. And it's not that bad.",,,,,,,,,
261,,,,"Wait, really? In that case, I'm taking a fry, I wanna try it.",,,,,,,,,
261,,,,You're gonna have a taste of everyone's order by the time we're done…,,,,,,,,,
262,,,,My hands hurt…,,,,,,,,,
262,,,,"Well, yeah. You played the same song nonstop for an hour.",,,,,,,,,
262,,,,"I wanted to get a perfect score! I was just warming up, I could've totally gotten on the scoreboard if I wanted.",,,,,,,,,
262,,,,"Yeah, I believe you. Maybe choose an easier song next time, though. ",,,,,,,,,
262,,,,"Still, it's cool that they have these machines. I've only ever played the console version. It's a totally different feel.",,,,,,,,,
262,,,,"I know, right? I just wish it had some newer Miku songs. These songs are kinda outdated.",,,,,,,,,
262,,,,Kinda hard to do that when it's discontinued.  ,,,,,,,,,
262,,,,"Hiroshi! Where did you and Raika go, anyway? It was your turn next.",,,,,,,,,
262,,,,You were taking too long. We went to the claw machines.,,,,,,,,,
262,,,,"Aw, that's a cute bunny plush. Only one?",,,,,,,,,
262,,,,"…I spent all my credits. Raika ended up helping me, anyway.",,,,,,,,,
262,,,,All I did was tell an employee to reposition it. It's the least they could do after you spent as much as you did.,,,,,,,,,
262,,,,"Yeah, but still… Thanks, Raika. ",,,,,,,,,
263,,,,"Mayuko, can you at least *try* to be professional online?",,,,,,,,,
263,,,,What? I'm totally professional! Did I forget to switch accounts or something?,,,,,,,,,
263,,,,"I'm talking about your main. Even if it's not the cyberTHESIS account, everyone's gonna associate you with it.",,,,,,,,,
263,,,,I've already seen posts about you going on a frenzy online.,,,,,,,,,
263,,,,A frenzy?? What was Mayuko posting?,,,,,,,,,
263,,,,Just quoting the announcement for age of audio's new single. Like. 20 times.,,,,,,,,,
263,,,,"Blah, you're such a stick in the mud.  I'm just hyping them up! ",,,,,,,,,
263,,,,"Yurina, you do that, right? If your friend posted a new song, you'd go and promote it to your followers too!",,,,,,,,,
263,,,,"I mean… I'm not close with other DJs like that, so…",,,,,,,,,
263,,,,Raika?,,,,,,,,,
263,,,,"Bands usually do their own advertising. I'll post schedules on the website, but that's it. ",,,,,,,,,
263,,,,See? Yurina and Raika are normal. Just get a priv or something.,,,,,,,,,
263,,,,Fineeeeeee. Maybe I'll just have a secret side account.,,,,,,,,,
264,,,,"Mayuko, I can't work with this. I have no idea what you're trying to say.",,,,,,,,,
264,,,,"You know!!!! Like… it's going to be like, BANG! and BOOM! And then I'll jump to the super yay part in this song.",,,,,,,,,
264,,,,"You're just repeating yourself… Hiroshi, a little help?",,,,,,,,,
264,,,,"What am I, her translator? I can't read her mind.",,,,,,,,,
264,,,,"Ughhhhhhhh!!! Hiroshi, it's kinda like that one sample you use for everything. That one. ",,,,,,,,,
264,,,,"Oh. Wait, yeah, I know which part she's talking about. Here, Raika, I'll show you.",,,,,,,,,
264,,,,I see… but what on earth is the 'super yay part'? ,,,,,,,,,
264,,,,It's like… the bit that sounds orange.,,,,,,,,,
264,,,,"Yeah, no clue.",,,,,,,,,
264,,,,*sigh*…,,,,,,,,,
264,,,,"Hey, don't look so down. We'll probably get what you mean when you show us your mix.",,,,,,,,,
264,,,,"Yeah… When we make music, Hiroshi usually knows what I'm trying to do. Or I'll just do it myself. ",,,,,,,,,
264,,,,Then we should probably teach you more technical terms than 'super yay'…,,,,,,,,,
265,,,,Phew! That was too close. I almost tripped over my bag trying to hide in time.,,,,,,,,,
265,,,,"Honestly, I don't know how we got away with that…",,,,,,,,,
265,,,,"Um, because *I* had an excuse locked and loaded. You're welcome, by the way.",,,,,,,,,
265,,,,That's not something to be proud of. Don't you feel bad lying to the teacher's face like that??,,,,,,,,,
265,,,,Won't *you* feel bad if Sanae gets caught?,,,,,,,,,
265,,,,…I mean. It's not like anyone gets hurt…,,,,,,,,,
265,,,,"Exactly. As long as she doesn't find out, it's no one's problem but ours.",,,,,,,,,
265,,,,Maybe I should try hiding in SEKAI next time. It'll probably be quicker than hiding under the teacher's desk. And there's no way she's finding me there!,,,,,,,,,
265,,,,"She might get concerned if she sees the flash of light, though… I don't know how we'll explain that.",,,,,,,,,
265,,,,"Ahaha, true… Oh, I know! What if you said that…",,,,,,,,,
265,,,,(—I can't believe this is what my school life has come to…),,,,,,,,,
266,,,,It's been a while since I've done karaoke…,,,,,,,,,
266,,,,"Yeah, same here. Fair warning, guys, I'm seriously out of practice. ",,,,,,,,,
266,,,,"You're fine, Sanae. At least you've had practice.",,,,,,,,,
266,,,,"When we choose a song, is there an order we have to sing? Are we assigning lines..?",,,,,,,,,
266,,,,"Koharu, this isn't a rehearsal. You pick a song and sing whatever parts you want. ",,,,,,,,,
266,,,,"Well, forgive me for wanting clarification.",,,,,,,,,
266,,,,"Still, I can't believe you've never done karaoke before… It's fun. You'll like it.",,,,,,,,,
266,,,,I call first pick. I heard they added more of MORE MORE JUMP's songs to the machine. ,,,,,,,,,
266,,,,Shouldn't you let Sanae choose first? She has to leave early.,,,,,,,,,
266,,,,"No, it's fine! Actually, I kinda wanted to see you sing, Kaori.",,,,,,,,,
266,,,,Really?,,,,,,,,,
266,,,,"Well, yeah! It's not everyday I get to see an idol sing up close! ",,,,,,,,,
266,,,,"…Hehe, in that case, prepared to be amazed~ I'll give you an idol-worthy performance!",,,,,,,,,
267,,,,"Oh, there's Koharu!",,,,,,,,,
267,,,,Koharu! Over here!!!,,,,,,,,,
267,,,,Oh!! Welcome!! What can I get for…,,,,,,,,,
267,,,,…You… today…,,,,,,,,,
267,,,,?,,,,,,,,,
267,,,,?,,,,,,,,,
267,,,,?,,,,,,,,,
267,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
267,,,,"Well, waiter, what do you recommend~?",,,,,,,,,
267,,,,Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh…,,,,,,,,,
267,,,,Is work really that bad..? I thought you liked working there?,,,,,,,,,
267,,,,"No. No, it's great. I get paid, so I can't complain.",,,,,,,,,
267,,,,"It's just exhausting. Standing around and smiling all the time, acting all friendly, like I care what type of pancake they want…",,,,,,,,,
267,,,,And then there's the people who think I *do* want to be their friend!!! As if I'm not *working!!!!!!!!*,,,,,,,,,
267,,,,"Yeah, that sounds about right. Sucks, but that's business.",,,,,,,,,
267,,,,"If Koharu's tired, maybe we should go home early?",,,,,,,,,
267,,,,"No, it's fine. You already had to wait for me to get off work.",,,,,,,,,
267,,,,Are you sure…?,,,,,,,,,
267,,,,Seriously? I was looking forward to this all shift. Let's go already.,,,,,,,,,
268,,,,That was fun… Thanks for letting me drag you guys here.,,,,,,,,,
268,,,,"Of course!! I love Spojoy, I was super excited to hear you wanted to go with us. ",,,,,,,,,
268,,,,"They opened the laser tag arena recently, so I wanted to give it a try…",,,,,,,,,
268,,,,"Um, but to be honest, I just wanted to hold the laser guns. They made the gear look really cool.",,,,,,,,,
268,,,,"No need to be so humble, I know what you mean. They designed it to look futuristic, but not so flashy that it wouldn't be practical…",,,,,,,,,
268,,,,Is that why you did so bad? You were too focused on the costume design? ,,,,,,,,,
268,,,,Ghh— I kept getting cornered! What was I supposed to do?!,,,,,,,,,
268,,,,"Um, not let yourself be cornered. Classic laser tag strat.",,,,,,,,,
268,,,,"I mean, she's kinda right. You kept going back to the same area. It was easy to predict where you'd go. ",,,,,,,,,
268,,,,Thanks for the feedback…,,,,,,,,,
268,,,,"Hehe. If you guys want to, let's go again some other time. I want to do another round. ",,,,,,,,,
268,,,,Sounds good to me. I need to get my revenge.,,,,,,,,,
268,,,,Eek…,,,,,,,,,
269,,,,*crumble*,,,,,,,,,
269,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
269,,,,"Well, we can't use the stage. On account of the… concrete rubble everywhere. ",,,,,,,,,
269,,,,You sure? That slab of concrete looks stable enough. ,,,,,,,,,
269,,,,I am *not* climbing through all this debris. These clothes are brand new. ,,,,,,,,,
269,,,,"Come on, Koharu, it's just a bit of rubble. Or are you scared to get your hands dirty?",,,,,,,,,
269,,,,"Don't talk to me about getting my hands dirty. When's the last time you've practiced anywhere but a nice, clean studio?",,,,,,,,,
269,,,,"Guys, don't start with this…",,,,,,,,,
269,,,,Let's just wait out Miku and MEIKO's battle… SEKAI should go back to normal after they're done. ,,,,,,,,,
269,,,,"Yeah, I don't think I want to practice while MEIKO's around, anyway. ",,,,,,,,,
269,,,,"If they take too long, you guys can keep going without me. I have an advisor meeting I need to go to.",,,,,,,,,
269,,,,But this routine won't work without the four of us…,,,,,,,,,
269,,,,"Oh well, that's fine. We'll just have to cut the meeting short. ",,,,,,,,,
269,,,,Oh…,,,,,,,,,
269,,,,Fine by me! That just means I can get home and start prepping dinner early. ,,,,,,,,,
269,,,,"Yeah, Chiyomi, don't feel bad. There's always next time.",,,,,,,,,
270,,,,"Hey, we've basically got the hang of this!! Good job, everyone!!!",,,,,,,,,
270,,,,Nice! Time for a break~ Maybe we should get a treat to celebrate.,,,,,,,,,
270,,,,As if you need a break… you had your part down on the first week. ,,,,,,,,,
270,,,,"Actually, since we have the time, shouldn't we try practicing in our outfits? If there's any adjustments I need to make, I want to start early.",,,,,,,,,
270,,,,"I mean, I don't mind. If it makes things faster…",,,,,,,,,
270,,,,Blah. What's the rush? It's not like we have a deadline or anything.,,,,,,,,,
270,,,,It just feels like we're going slow…,,,,,,,,,
270,,,,"Well, we're not meeting everyday, so that's just expected.",,,,,,,,,
270,,,,"But it's not like we're trying to be actual idols, right? So I think this pace is fine!",,,,,,,,,
270,,,,"Koharu, are you seriously going to argue against grabbing food together? How heartless can you be?",,,,,,,,,
270,,,,"I never said that—! Nevermind, let's decide on what to get.",,,,,,,,,
271,,,,"…So what you're saying is, we're all completely doomed…",,,,,,,,,
271,,,,STOP SAYING THAT!! You're seriously freaking me out!!! ,,,,,,,,,
271,,,,Um… At least we're doomed together?,,,,,,,,,
271,,,,WAHHH!!! That's NOT HELPING!!!!,,,,,,,,,
271,,,,"Everyone, please, we shouldn't despair like this…",,,,,,,,,
271,,,,"I mean… you two already had the quiz, but Ami and I still have a chance, right? If we study right now…",,,,,,,,,
271,,,,"If you'd like, Rion and I can tell you what questions were on the quiz. Would that help?",,,,,,,,,
271,,,,"Hold on, isn't that cheating..?",,,,,,,,,
271,,,,"Yeah, stop, why am I getting roped into this?",,,,,,,,,
271,,,,Oh.,,,,,,,,,
271,,,,But Toshi is right!! Desperate times call for desperate measures!!! ,,,,,,,,,
271,,,,"Pleaseeeeeee, Rion? Prettiest please? Please to infinity?",,,,,,,,,
271,,,,"...Fine. You have a better chance at passing than I do, anyway.",,,,,,,,,
271,,,,"But I also have more to lose. So if we get caught, we're all going down together.",,,,,,,,,
271,,,,Eek…,,,,,,,,,
271,,,,"That is to say, we're not getting caught.",,,,,,,,,
271,,,,"…Um, actually, Keishi, how about we go over the textbook chapters together?",,,,,,,,,
271,,,,"Y-yeah, actually, we'll just study on our own...",,,,,,,,,
272,,,,*click* *click* *click*,,,,,,,,,
272,,,,The light's gonna turn red before we can cross…,,,,,,,,,
272,,,,"*click* There, is that all?",,,,,,,,,
272,,,,"Hmmm… yep, that's good! Thanks again, Rion~",,,,,,,,,
272,,,,"But one day, you gotta let me take pictures for you. I got, like, a BUNCH of pose ideas!!! ",,,,,,,,,
272,,,,Not happening. Especially not in the middle of the crossing.,,,,,,,,,
272,,,,Pleaseeeee!! I won't post it anywhere!!!,,,,,,,,,
272,,,,Don't push it.,,,,,,,,,
272,,,,Eek… Okay…,,,,,,,,,
272,,,,"Ami, would you like me to pose for you instead? ",,,,,,,,,
272,,,,"Wait, really? Of course~! Here, just stand here and copy what I do! ",,,,,,,,,
272,,,,…Seriously??? You're so stiff. ,,,,,,,,,
272,,,,Oh. How about this?,,,,,,,,,
272,,,,That's barely any better!,,,,,,,,,
272,,,,COME ON!!!! Stretch those arms!!! Put some energy into it!!!!,,,,,,,,,
272,,,,"Oh, move a bit to the left! It'll look cool with the screen centered behind you.",,,,,,,,,
272,,,,"Ooooh, good eye! Now take a step back!",,,,,,,,,
272,,,,Further!!!,,,,,,,,,
272,,,,Andddddddd—!,,,,,,,,,
272,,,,"Get back here, all of you. The light's turning red.",,,,,,,,,
272,,,,Oh…,,,,,,,,,
272,,,,Ahh… oh well. Let's just take the passageway.,,,,,,,,,
273,,,,I'm just not sure if we need band outfits…,,,,,,,,,
273,,,,"We're only playing at the school festival, can't we just wear our uniform..?",,,,,,,,,
273,,,,Absolutely NOT!!!! We're not going up on stage looking like a bunch of boring nobodies!!! We need to blow the competition out of the water!!!! ,,,,,,,,,
273,,,,And I'm NOT letting you guys wear THAT.,,,,,,,,,
273,,,,…Fair enough. But you're gonna have to lead the way. I don't know the rules to all this. ,,,,,,,,,
273,,,,Don't worry~ Toshiki got the hang of it quickly enough.,,,,,,,,,
273,,,,"Yeah, speaking of, where'd the boys go?",,,,,,,,,
273,,,,"I dunno, I let them loose somewhere. I wanna focus on YOU!",,,,,,,,,
273,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
273,,,,"…Umm. This looks like it should go under the blouse, right..? ",,,,,,,,,
273,,,,I'm not too sure… Maybe you should try it on and see?,,,,,,,,,
273,,,,"Oh, ok! I'll be right back.",,,,,,,,,
274,,,,STOP!!!!! Stop stop stop!!!! We keep messing up here!!!!!!!!! ,,,,,,,,,
274,,,,"Sorry, Ami… I think I'm being too slow…",,,,,,,,,
274,,,,"No no no, YOU'RE fine. It's Toshi and Rion! They keep rushing through the prechorus!",,,,,,,,,
274,,,,Oh…,,,,,,,,,
274,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
274,,,,"Come on, Toshi, lock in!",,,,,,,,,
274,,,,Sorry about that… I'll keep practicing this part on my own.,,,,,,,,,
274,,,,"Toshiki, your playing is fine. She's saying you need to keep with Keishiro's drumming. ",,,,,,,,,
274,,,,"If anything, we probably need more group practice. We're really out of sync.",,,,,,,,,
274,,,,Oh.,,,,,,,,,
274,,,,"You too, Rion! You know that you're supposed to keep with Keishi.",,,,,,,,,
274,,,,"I mean! If it's easier, maybe I should speed up during this part?",,,,,,,,,
274,,,,What? No!!! Why are you trying to mess up on purpose?? You're literally the only one doing it right! ,,,,,,,,,
274,,,,Ah… sorry…,,,,,,,,,
274,,,,…I'm taking a break. Be back in half an hour.,,,,,,,,,
274,,,,"?!?! W-Wait! I was just saying, I wasn't angry or anything! ",,,,,,,,,
274,,,,Rion!!!!!!!,,,,,,,,,
274,,,,She's totally mad at us…,,,,,,,,,
274,,,,I don't think so… she's probably just tired. We have been practicing for a while. ,,,,,,,,,
274,,,,I think a break will do us good. We'll try again with a fresh set of ears. ,,,,,,,,,
275,,,,"Oh, Toshiki! What's with the papers?",,,,,,,,,
275,,,,It's the application to perform at the school festival… I'm looking over it for any errors.,,,,,,,,,
275,,,,"Wait, you still haven't submitted it? You already had me check it over yesterday. ",,,,,,,,,
275,,,,"Yes, but… I just want to make sure. We can't make any changes after it's submitted.",,,,,,,,,
275,,,,"Geez, haven't you checked it enough? What if you take too long and miss the deadline?",,,,,,,,,
275,,,,"I mean, he's just being careful! We still have a couple of days, so…",,,,,,,,,
275,,,,Gimme that!,,,,,,,,,
275,,,,Ami?!,,,,,,,,,
275,,,,"Once Keishi and I look it over, you're going to the council and submitting it, PRONTO! We're not gonna miss out on this cuz you're dragging your feet!",,,,,,,,,
275,,,,…I understand. Sorry for the delay.,,,,,,,,,
275,,,,Not like there's any be any issues anyway. It's been triple-checked by now.,,,,,,,,,
276,,,,Toshiki!,,,,,,,,,
276,,,,Oh. Hi Sanae. Do you need something?,,,,,,,,,
276,,,,"Can't I check in on my little brother? You're eating your lunch, right?",,,,,,,,,
276,,,,Yes.,,,,,,,,,
276,,,,You're not having trouble with classwork?,,,,,,,,,
276,,,,Yes.,,,,,,,,,
276,,,,You're having fun in brass band?,,,,,,,,,
276,,,,…Yes.,,,,,,,,,
276,,,,"Okay, just checking! I feel like I never see you outside of school.",,,,,,,,,
276,,,,"I know you want to practice your violin, but you can practice at home too, y'know.",,,,,,,,,
276,,,,It's fine. You don't need to worry about me…,,,,,,,,,
276,,,,"In any case, I have band practice with my friends today. So I'll be home late again.",,,,,,,,,
276,,,,…?!!!!?!?!?!?!,,,,,,,,,
276,,,,"Toshiki, you're in a band?!?! You have friends?!?!?!?!",,,,,,,,,
276,,,,Oh. Did you not know..?,,,,,,,,,
276,,,,No?! That's incredible!!!!!!! Tell me about them!! Do your band have a name yet? Did you take up another instrument?!,,,,,,,,,
276,,,,Aah…,,,,,,,,,
277,,,,"Excuse me, Sanae.",,,,,,,,,
277,,,,"Toshiki! Sorry, you're gonna have to walk with me, I'm carrying these chairs back to the classroom.",,,,,,,,,
277,,,,Do you need help? I can carry some for you.,,,,,,,,,
277,,,,"No way, you'll hurt your back! I can handle it.",,,,,,,,,
277,,,,I'm not that weak… It'll be quicker with the two of us.,,,,,,,,,
277,,,,"*huff* Seriously, Toshiki, when I say I can handle it, I can handle it. Now, what did you want?",,,,,,,,,
277,,,,Ah…,,,,,,,,,
277,,,,"It wasn't anything important… It's just, you're going to be busy with the festival coming up, right?",,,,,,,,,
277,,,,"Yep! Actually, the work's already started. The deadline's soon, so we're just waiting on any last-minute submissions.",,,,,,,,,
277,,,,I see… ,,,,,,,,,
277,,,,"In that case, would you like me to pick up Akari and Yuuka afterschool? It would be easier for you if I watch them.",,,,,,,,,
277,,,,"…Ha, I see what you're trying to do. Nice try, Toshiki!",,,,,,,,,
277,,,,"But seriously, it's fine. You focus on your own life. You have that concert coming up, right? ",,,,,,,,,
277,,,,"Yes, but…",,,,,,,,,
277,,,,…If you say so.,,,,,,,,,
277,,,,(…She doesn't need to know that I quit brass band. I'll just cause more trouble.),,,,,,,,,
278,,,,Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh…,,,,,,,,,
278,,,,Why is everyone so stupid… all the time…,,,,,,,,,
278,,,,"Hey, um… Sano, are you okay..?",,,,,,,,,
278,,,,1?!2?4$) ,,,,,,,,,
278,,,,Oh! Kumazawa. I'm fine. Just taking my break!,,,,,,,,,
278,,,,"You're usually so cheerful, though. Did something happen?",,,,,,,,,
278,,,,"No, nothing like that! I'm just… having an off-day. ",,,,,,,,,
278,,,,"Ah!! Sorry!! I'm, probably overstepping!!!",,,,,,,,,
278,,,,"But if there's anything I can do to help, let me know! We're a team! ",,,,,,,,,
278,,,,"…Thanks, Kumazawa. I appreciate it.",,,,,,,,,
278,,,,"But really, you can go now.",,,,,,,,,
278,,,,"Oh, okay!",,,,,,,,,
278,,,,…,,,,,,,,,
278,,,,(I think he's gone. Where was I…),,,,,,,,,
278,,,,Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhh…,,,,,,,,,
279,,,,,,,,,,,,,
279,,,,,,,,,,,,,
279,,,,,,,,,,,,,
279,,,,,,,,,,,,,
280,,,,,,,,,,,,,
281,,,,You guys are lifesavers… Sorry I had to drag you two away from your lunch.,,,,,,,,,
281,,,,"I thought I could set up the auditorium's mixer myself, but… too many switches…",,,,,,,,,
281,,,,"Don't be sorry, I get why you were overwhelmed. It was an easy fix, anyway.",,,,,,,,,
281,,,,"Yeah, you can hit up Raika whenever. This stuff is like, her job description.",,,,,,,,,
281,,,,Don't just offer me up. It's your job description too. ,,,,,,,,,
281,,,,Not unless you're holding a rave in the auditorium.,,,,,,,,,
281,,,,"Ugh. Just ignore her, Kakinuma.",,,,,,,,,
281,,,,"If you need any technical help, feel free to ask. I know you have a lot on your plate.",,,,,,,,,
281,,,,"It's fine! I think I got it this time, so I won't be bothering you anytime soon.",,,,,,,,,
281,,,,,,,,,,,,,
