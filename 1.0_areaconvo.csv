1,,,,I forgot about the math homework due today...,,,,,,,
,,,,I wonder if Koharu will let me copy hers?,,,,,,,
,,,,Hmm...,,,,,,,
,,,,"Actually, screw that. I'll just do it right now!",,,,,,,
,,,,"It was like, Hospital's rule or something? Can't be that hard.",,,,,,,
2,,,,Oh oh oh! That musician is back!,,,,,,,
,,,,"(I saw a bit of their performance the other day, but in the middle of the song, they grabbed their things and ran off!)",,,,,,,
,,,,Yay~★ I hope they play some more this time.,,,,,,,
3,,,,"Ooooh, the band on that billboard, I think I've seen them before…",,,,,,,
,,,,Leo/need… Leo/need… Um…,,,,,,,
,,,,Oh yeah! Hiroshi and I saw them at Jamfest last year. The one with the really cool frontman! ,,,,,,,
,,,,Not as cool as DIOS though.,,,,,,,
4,,,,"Oh, Nightcord tweeted something!",,,,,,,
,,,,Looks like they're celebrating their anniversary soon.,,,,,,,
,,,,"(They've been on hiatus for a while. It makes sense, though. I think most of them are in uni now...)",,,,,,,
,,,,"(Still, I'm glad they remembered their fans.)",,,,,,,
,,,,Maybe I should rearrange one of their songs as a tribute.,,,,,,,
5,,,,(Too many people…),,,,,,,
,,,,"(I just wanted to pick up age of audio's new single, but apparently, this is rush hour for all the most annoying, inconvinent people in the city.)",,,,,,,
,,,,(—Ugh! The light is green! Why the hell do you want to take photos in the middle of the crosswalk?),,,,,,,
,,,,(Move!!!),,,,,,,
6,,,,I really hope I'm wrong… It used to be around here somewhere…,,,,,,,
,,,,! ,,,,,,,
,,,,Thank god. They're still open. ,,,,,,,
,,,,"This livehouse wasn't doing well, last time I went. I thought they were shutting down for good.",,,,,,,
,,,,I guess it really was just construction.,,,,,,,
,,,,I'll buy a ticket for tonight's show. I hope they still have the juice machine.,,,,,,,
7,,,,This is bullshit. I'm basically an adult. Why does it matter if I'm not wearing the uniform?,,,,,,,
,,,,"They should have a day where everyone can wear what they want. Make it a spirit day, or something.",,,,,,,
,,,,"...Actually, that might get chaotic.",,,,,,,
8,,,,(Ohhhhhhh no.),,,,,,,
,,,,"(I reached out to that guy for a gig last month, and I totally forgot to follow up with him on it.)",,,,,,,
,,,,(I don't think he noticed me yet. Maybe…),,,,,,,
,,,,"Excuse me, sorry, just need to get past you...",,,,,,,
9,,,,You'd think Miku would spend some time cleaning this place… ,,,,,,,
,,,,"I borrowed one of her headphones, but the supply closet's such a mess. I don't even know where this is supposed to go.",,,,,,,
,,,,"…Blah, I give up. She can deal with it.",,,,,,,
10,,,,(That billboard...),,,,,,,
,,,,"(age of audio just released a single, so obviously, they're going to market it.)",,,,,,,
,,,,(I wonder if the others got a copy…),,,,,,,
,,,,"(…No, I can't think about that. I have my own responsibilities to handle.)",,,,,,,
11,,,,"Oh, these shirts are cute. Especially the one with the floral accents.",,,,,,,
,,,,Should I get it..? I don't know when I'd get a chance to wear them though. Most of the time I'm working in the dark.,,,,,,,
,,,,Hmm…,,,,,,,
,,,,"Actually, whatever. I'll buy it and save it for a slow day. ",,,,,,,
12,,,,Jesus. Are we a bunch of animals?,,,,,,,
,,,,Who leaves their headphones on the ground for anyone to trip over??,,,,,,,
,,,,"(Usually, I'd blame Yurina, but apparently Miku's just as bad...)",,,,,,,
,,,,"Whatever. If she won't clean this place up, I will. Then she'll be sorry.",,,,,,,
13,,,,I shouldn't have offered to take that shift... I completely forgot about the math homework.,,,,,,,
,,,,Maybe Mayuko will let me copy hers..?,,,,,,,
,,,,"...No, nevermind. I can't have her thinking I don't take my studies seriously.",,,,,,,
,,,,I'll just finish it now and hope she goes easy on me...,,,,,,,
14,,,,First I overslept. Then I forgot to pack my math textbook this morning.,,,,,,,
,,,,"Then I had to borrow from Chiyomi, because I forgot to bring money for lunch…",,,,,,,
,,,,And now I'm going to be late to my shift!!!,,,,,,,
,,,,"Seriously, what the hell! Who did I piss off? Did I do something in a past life to deserve all this?!",,,,,,,
,,An Ominous Visage from God,\,*somehow i play danganronpa music here*,,,,,,,
,,,,…,,,,,,,
15,,,,Miku?,,,,,,,
,,,,"(Hmm, I can't find her outside…)",,,,,,,
,,,,"(Does that mean she's in the building? She always says that she's skipping class when she's out here, but…)",,,,,,,
,,,,"(I mean, no way she actually has classes to attend! What would she even be learning? Who would be teaching?)",,,,,,,
,,,,"(…But if she is, that means it must be important. I shouldn't take her away from her education.) ",,,,,,,
,,,,"Nevermind, I'll just find her later.",,,,,,,
16,,,,Support classes are over… ,,,,,,,
,,,,"(I'm supposed to go right back to homeroom, but no one's caught me coming out here yet…)",,,,,,,
,,,,…Just until my headache goes away.,,,,,,,
,,,,…,,,,,,,
,,,,The courtyard's really nice without all the noise…,,,,,,,
17,,,,"Oh, the line for the pop-up cafe is super long…",,,,,,,
,,,,(Damn it. I wish school didn't go on for so long… I could've lined up earlier.),,,,,,,
,,,,"...*Sigh* The pain of having your niche series blow up, I guess.",,,,,,,
19,,,,(I shouldn't have signed up for this...),,,,,,,
,,,,"(I only joined the disciplinary committee to get out of class easier, but actually marking people up is a pain.)",,,,,,,
,,,,(Why can't everyone just do what they're told?),,,,,,,
,,,,"...! Hey, that's not the uniform!",,,,,,,
,,,,Wha— Come back!!!,,,,,,,
20,,,,"Yuuta and Akari are with their friends, so I have some time to kill.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Mmm, I kinda don't want to do homework though… It's such a lovely day outside!",,,,,,,
,,,,"I'd go for a proper run, but I can't leave the girls out of my sight. I'll just do laps around the playground.",,,,,,,
21,,,,Council meeting is over… ,,,,,,,
,,,,"Oh no, that went on for way too long! I'm going to be late to pick up the girls.",,,,,,,
,,,,Maybe I should ask Toshiki to…,,,,,,,
,,,,"—No, I can make it! I'll just have to run! ",,,,,,,
22,,,,"Honestly, I didn't even have to come back to class. There's only half an hour before school lets out.",,,,,,,
,,,,"...But there's a meeting today, and Sanae's coming all the way from Kamiyama. I can't be skipping just for the hell of it.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Besides, what would they do without me? My glorious, guiding presence? I'm practically the heart of the club! ",,,,,,,
23,,,,(I survived today's session…),,,,,,,
,,,,"(…Ha, I can speak just fine in the recording booth, but when it comes to anything outside of that…)",,,,,,,
,,,,(I'm such a fraud. How long until they find out? Or maybe they already know…),,,,,,,
,,,,"(…Forget it. I need to calm my nerves. I'll take twenty minutes, then go home.)",,,,,,,
24,,,,I don't think they'll find me here.,,,,,,,
,,,,"(Miku and the others are nice and all, but sometimes, I don't want to entertain them.)",,,,,,,
,,,,"(And when I *do* talk to Miku, she acts so strange. I don't know what she expects from me.)",,,,,,,
,,,,I'll just take five minutes. I have to head back out soon.,,,,,,,
25,,,,I do wish the music room wasn't so busy during lunch. I'd like to get some practice in before the period ends.,,,,,,,
,,,,"Usually, there's people in the classrooms, so I can't go there. And I already practice outside, so the rooftop isn't ideal either. ",,,,,,,
,,,,"(Actually, Sanae might get on my case about not eating lunch again...)",,,,,,,
,,,,Nevermind. I'll just wait until afterschool to practice.,,,,,,,
26,,,,I got chased out...,,,,,,,
,,,,(I didn't need a permit to perform here before... When did they implement that?),,,,,,,
,,,,"(...Why does this keep happening? Everything, always changing…)",,,,,,,
,,,,...It can't be helped. I'll head to the park and practice there.,,,,,,,
27,,,,— ♪,,,,,,,
,,,,(That was passable.),,,,,,,
,,,,"(Usually, my wrist and shoulder would be hurting at this point. I suppose Rion had a point about my posture...)",,,,,,,
,,,,Alright. Once more.,,,,,,,
28,,,,"(Usually, the hall monitors get on my case about following the dress code...",,,,,,,
,,,,"...But ever since the blonde one saw me with Toshiki, she's been looking the other way.)",,,,,,,
,,,,Kyahaha! The power of connections!,,,,,,,
,,,,"I dunno what Toshiki did, but I should thank him★",,,,,,,
29,,,,Oh. My. God.,,,,,,,
,,,,This chew toy is SO CUTE!!! What a cute little face!!!,,,,,,,
,,,,"I know these are for dogs to, like, chew on… but maybe Bonbon would want it?",,,,,,,
,,,,"…Eek, nevermind. Totally forgot about my spending plan.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Bonbon isn't a hunter, anyway. He'd probably snuggle with it, or toss it around when he's mad, or something.",,,,,,,
,,,,"…Wait, that would be really cute too…",,,,,,,
30,,,,"Hmph, the cool store clerk isn't here today…",,,,,,,
,,,,"I wasn't really planning on buying anything today, TBH. I only came here to tell her about the band.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Maybe I should, like, actually get her LINE…",,,,,,,
,,,,"…WAHHhh, too scary! Forget it, I'll just windowshop and go home.",,,,,,,
31,,,,"For some reason, the others never hang out in the music room during lunch.",,,,,,,
,,,,There's a lot of friendly people here! And the atmosphere's really nice!,,,,,,,
,,,,"Though, it's kinda a free-for-all in here. Maybe they don't like the chaos. ",,,,,,,
,,,,"And, um, everyone else has their groups. I'm all alone...",,,,,,,
,,,,"...! I know! Next time, I'll invite Toshiki and the others to have lunch with me! ",,,,,,,
32,,,,I haven't been to that instrument shop in a while...,,,,,,,
,,,,"When I was trying out for brass band, I'd go there almost every week. But now I just borrow the school's drumkit.",,,,,,,
,,,,I wonder how the owner's doing...,,,,,,,
,,,,"Actually, I think I'll visit soon! I need to get a drumkit of my own, anyway.",,,,,,,
33,,,,"(Ugh, I came all the way out here, but I still can't decide…)",,,,,,,
,,,,"(If I go to shopping mall, I can go to that one curry place Ami recommended, but then it'll take an extra time to go to the grocery store and get groceries…)",,,,,,,
,,,,"(But if I get groceries first, it might take too long, and they'll close for the night…)",,,,,,,
,,,,"(But it shouldn't take me that long, unless there's a line…)",,,,,,,
,,,,(But do I really want to carry around groceries all the way to the mall?),,,,,,,
,,,,! ,,,,,,,
,,,,"Sorry, sorry!! I'm going…",,,,,,,
34,,,,…I'm really behind. ,,,,,,,
,,,,"You miss one day of class, and everyone in English is suddenly Shakespeare. ",,,,,,,
,,,,But I can't keep relying on Toshiki… and I don't think anyone else in the class wants to share their notes. ,,,,,,,
,,,,…Whatever. Self-study it is.,,,,,,,
35,,,,I hope that one guitar place's still open. They had strings for a good price.,,,,,,,
,,,,"I really need to get back into practice. It's been so long since I last played properly, I've lost my callouses. ",,,,,,,
,,,,(Everyone's been so diligent about their instruments… I can't mess this up for them too.),,,,,,,
36,,,,— ♪,,,,,,,
,,,,(Toshiki's right. This is a good place to practice.),,,,,,,
,,,,"(I thought it would be busy, but there's a lot of space on this side. And it's an open area. I can be sure that no one's following me…)",,,,,,,
,,,,(…I need to get over myself.),,,,,,,
,,,,"(If we're going to perform as a band, I can't be holding them back.)",,,,,,,
37,,,,…,,,,,,,
,,,,"(Everything's gotten so lively, all of a sudden.)",,,,,,,
,,,,"(It's *so* annoying. Seriously, who the hell do they think they are?)",,,,,,,
,,,,(I was doing fine before they showed up. They basically desecrated the place just so they can practice.),,,,,,,
,,,,"(…At least they're good company. If they ever get boring, I'm kicking em out.)",,,,,,,
38,,,,"A-one, and a-two, and—",,,,,,,
,,,,(Yay! I got the kick and twirl right! Usually I spin too much and mess up my position for the next part.),,,,,,,
,,,,(I can probably get this part down by the end of the day!—),,,,,,,
,,,,*Distant explosion*,,,,,,,
,,,,(Aww… I spoke too soon…),,,,,,,
39,,,,"Oh, this display…",,,,,,,
,,,,"(I put up a sign not to mess with the exhibits, but someone's been in here. The belt on this stanchion isn't supposed to connect here.)",,,,,,,
,,,,*click*,,,,,,,
,,,,(…Good. They need to rebel a little.),,,,,,,
40,,,,Hi~ro~shi! Thanks for coming!,,,,,,,
,,,,You're lucky I haven't been escorted out yet. Why couldn't I just meet you at the gate?,,,,,,,
,,,,"But the teacher wanted me for something, and you would've had to wait outside for a while. At least here you can sit down and relax.",,,,,,,
,,,,?!?!?! That's it?!?!?! I could've gotten kicked out! ,,,,,,,
,,,,"Well, you didn't, so it all worked out in the end. Let's go!",,,,,,,
,,,,"Yeah, let's get out of here…",,,,,,,
41,,,,Hiroshi!!!,,,,,,,
,,,,"Oh, sure. Just come on in. Not like you'll get me in trouble if anyone sees you with me. ",,,,,,,
,,,,"Relax, it's not like anyone cares. Besides, you got to see my campus, so I wanna see yours!",,,,,,,
,,,,You can see my school when we have the festival. Just wait at the gate next time.,,,,,,,
,,,,Waaaah… Hiroshi doesn't want to hang out with me… I'm so lonely…,,,,,,,
,,,,We're literally going to VISR together right now.,,,,,,,
,,,,Oh yeah. Yay ★,,,,,,,
42,,,,"So yeah, I had to do the homework during my lunch period. It sucked.",,,,,,,
,,,,"On the bright side, I totally thought I was going to get a 0, but look! I passed★",,,,,,,
,,,,"You got a 70%, what the hell are you so proud for? Do your homework on time.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Not what you're supposed to say. You should be praising me for my quick thinking, or for working well under pressure.",,,,,,,
,,,,"...Ok. Since you're such a genius, how about you help me with my math homework?",,,,,,,
,,,,Okay!,,,,,,,
,,,,(She agreed to that way too quickly...),,,,,,,
43,,,,"I was thinking, what if we made flyers? ",,,,,,,
,,,,Flyers? We don't even have any sets ready. ,,,,,,,
,,,,"I mean, yeah, but for practice! For when we do put on a set! ",,,,,,,
,,,,I'd rather practice beatmatching. The part that people actually care about?,,,,,,,
,,,,You're no fun… I *know* that. It's about manifesting it for us! Believing in ourselves! ,,,,,,,
,,,,"…I'll think about it. Raika might be better at graphic design, though. ",,,,,,,
44,,,,"Ooooh, Hiroshi, look! Let's try one!",,,,,,,
,,,,A capsule machine? I don't know any of these characters.,,,,,,,
,,,,Me neither! But the blue one with the face mask looks cool.,,,,,,,
,,,,"Aww, didn't get her… Hiroshi, you like can badges, you should try!",,,,,,,
,,,,I'm not gonna waste my money on a character I don't even know. What are you going to do with that?,,,,,,,
,,,,Uh… I was gonna give it to you.,,,,,,,
,,,,Figured. Maybe you'll find someone else who wants it.,,,,,,,
45,,,,I wonder how big this place actually is?,,,,,,,
,,,,"I mean, the main area isn't that much bigger than VISR's, but I don't think I've explored the entire back yet.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Dude, this place is huge as is. I've been to livehouses smaller than this place's lobby.",,,,,,,
,,,,It's just that half of the space is a mess. I don't think we can get past all those wires without shears.,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yeah, maybe we should focus on where we are now.",,,,,,,
46,,,,Yurina!!,,,,,,,
,,,,Mayuko? What's up? I don't think we're meeting today—,,,,,,,
,,,,Wanna come with me to the music shop? age of audio's new single is out!!,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm just on my way to buy it! There's a deluxe edition too, but there's a limited amount, so I wanted to try and—",,,,,,,
,,,,You already got it?!?!,,,,,,,
,,,,Ha! Who's DIOS' number one fan now?,,,,,,,
,,,,"…Hey, I'm just kidding. I bought it in a moment of weakness. Here.",,,,,,,
,,,,Really? I can just have it?,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yeah, I'm not gonna use it. I'll just get a digital download if I need a copy.",,,,,,,
,,,,Thank you!! You're the best!!,,,,,,,
47,,,,"Yurina, you're always so busy. How'd you do it? You must be super popular!",,,,,,,
,,,,You're giving me too much credit. I'm not *that* popular… ,,,,,,,
,,,,"Honestly, it's mostly talking to people. Keep putting yourself out there, and someone will take you up.",,,,,,,
,,,,It's even better if someone else puts in a good word for you. Then you really need to do your best.,,,,,,,
,,,,"Oh, really? That's easy ★ Can you put a good word for Hiro and I?",,,,,,,
,,,,"Uh… Let's save making connections for later. First, you have to actually know what you're doing. ",,,,,,,
,,,,"(Also, I don't think my word really means anything…)",,,,,,,
48,,,,"You don't need to jump right into learning CDJs, y'know. A regular controller is fine for now, and way cheaper.",,,,,,,
,,,,Really? Phew! I thought I'd have to save up again.,,,,,,,
,,,,"You said you bought an electric guitar recently, too… Do you *always* buy stuff as soon as you want to try it out?",,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey, I don't buy things on a whim. Obviously I save up my money.",,,,,,,
,,,,"I've wanted this guitar for a *long* time, so it's not like I have any regrets. If I needed a CDJ, I would've just saved up for that too.",,,,,,,
,,,,I don't think you know how much it would cost… But at least you have some self-control.,,,,,,,
49,,,,"Mayuko, you have a dog too?",,,,,,,
,,,,"Yep! Actually, he just kinda shows up around our house, but he's basically mine. He really likes me.",,,,,,,
,,,,"His name is Bandit. He's got these cool markings around his face, it makes him look like he's wearing a bandit mask!",,,,,,,
,,,,"Huh. Never heard of a breed that has markings like that. Mine's a corgi, but my brother was boring and named him Fido. ",,,,,,,
,,,,"That's cute though!! We should let them meet. Once I get Bandit on a collar, we can have a puppy playdate! ",,,,,,,
,,,,Does he not have a collar..?,,,,,,,
,,,,"I mean, I bought one for him, but everytime I try to put it on, he gets super mean and growls at me. ",,,,,,,
,,,,(Growls?!),,,,,,,
,,,,"…Uh, sure. I'll think about it.",,,,,,,
,,,,"(Sorry Mayuko, but your dog doesn't really sound tame…)",,,,,,,
50,,,,"Yurina, have you ever been here before? Like, before we showed you this place.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Uh, no. Why?",,,,,,,
,,,,"Just curious! I mean, Miku said something about a previous SEKAI owner, but whenever I try to ask, she just tells me to leave her alone.",,,,,,,
,,,,"So I've been trying to investigate! How about Raika, do you think it's her? ",,,,,,,
,,,,"...Yeah, no, I don't think she's going to entertain that. She'll probably tell you to focus on your sets.",,,,,,,
,,,,Aww... That's all my leads.,,,,,,,
,,,,"...Hey, be careful who you talk to about SEKAI. Miku barely tolerates us as is, she's not gonna want anyone else involved.",,,,,,,
,,,,"I am careful! Whatever, I'll just talk to Hiroshi, he's smart.",,,,,,,
56,,,,You're emphasizing the wrong syllable. You're saying it like you're producing a track. ,,,,,,,
,,,,"It's a noun, so you have to say it like PRO-duce. Like, there's a discount on the produce here.",,,,,,,
,,,,"...Yeah, I'm cooked. The oral exam's tomorrow. No way am I going to figure this out by then.",,,,,,,
,,,,"What? No, don't say that. Other than that, you're doing fine.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Really, I'm just nitpicking. She probably won't care about stuff like that.",,,,,,,
,,,,Really?,,,,,,,
,,,,"Beats me. I don't pay attention to the rubric. English is like, the one class I don't have to worry about.",,,,,,,
,,,,"...Great. Thanks anyway, Yurina.",,,,,,,
67,,,,Seriously? You got a warning *again*?,,,,,,,
,,,,Just wear a jacket over the uniform if you hate it that much.,,,,,,,
,,,,"It's not about that, it's about making a statement. It's not like what I wear affects my learning or anything.",,,,,,,
,,,,"It's about picking your battles. Besides, they won't let you wear whatever you want to the workplace either.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Exactly. They should let us cherish our youth, and let me wear BADWIMPS merch to school.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Ugh. Fine, do what you want.",,,,,,,
68,,,,…,,,,,,,
,,,,…,,,,,,,
,,,,(We're at a standoff…),,,,,,,
,,,,(I can't believe this. She's being dense on purpose.),,,,,,,
,,,,…*sigh*,,,,,,,
,,,,CanIhaveyourphysicsnotesfromyesterday.,,,,,,,
,,,,"Oh, so that's why you've been so cold all lunch. I thought you were about to confess~",,,,,,,
,,,,Because it should be obvious?! Do you think I ditch school because I feel like it? ,,,,,,,
,,,,I just wanted to hear you say it. How am I supposed to know what you want if you don't use your words? Communication is key. ,,,,,,,
,,,,"(That's rich, coming from you.)",,,,,,,
,,,,…Thanks. I just hope this isn't on today's quiz.,,,,,,,
,,,,"Course. Uh, I abbreviated some stuff, so let me know if you're confused.",,,,,,,
69,,,,Sanae is so responsible. ,,,,,,,
,,,,"She's on the student council and the disciplinary committee, and she's always helping out in class…",,,,,,,
,,,,"Huh? I mean, yeah, but what she does have to do with anything—",,,,,,,
,,,,You can't even tell someone when you have to cancel a gig! ,,,,,,,
,,,,"Seriously, can you *please* start showing up? I can't have people at VISR's door because they get in contact with you.",,,,,,,
,,,,"…Right. Yeah, got it.",,,,,,,
,,,,"(God, she's clueless. I'd tell her, but I can't out Sanae like that.)",,,,,,,
70,,,,Do you always go to the same cafe? Don't you get bored?,,,,,,,
,,,,"Not really. They have a quick turnaround time, and the atmosphere is nice. I like to answer emails here.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Hmm, good point. I think I'd feel bad if the workers started preparing my order in advance, though. ",,,,,,,
,,,,"What's bad about that? We both know what I want, so it's efficient for everyone.",,,,,,,
,,,,"What if you want to try something new? Or they change the recipe, and you don't like it anymore? Then you're betraying them.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Well, I don't want to try something new, so that's not gonna happen.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Seriously, stop worrying about hypotheticals and eat your creme bun.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Alright, alright. But I'm taking you to a cafe of my choice next time.",,,,,,,
71,,,,…I kinda wonder what this place looked like before.,,,,,,,
,,,,"Cleaner, I'd hope.",,,,,,,
,,,,"No, I'm serious. Miku said the original SEKAI owner abandoned this place before us. So did it fall into disrepair, or did it always look like this?",,,,,,,
,,,,"If I knew how long ago they left, maybe we can figure out a timeline—",,,,,,,
,,,,"Yurina, I'm not the one to talk to about this.",,,,,,,
,,,,I'm only here because I don't want Mayuko and Hiroshi to get hurt. I don't care about whoever was here before. Talk to one of them about your theories. ,,,,,,,
,,,,…Fair enough. Just curious.,,,,,,,
72,,,,What are you doing?,,,,,,,
,,,,"Organizing. The place is a mess. If we're going to practice here, we should at least have a platform we can work with.",,,,,,,
,,,,The hell?? You already have VISR to manage. Tell Miku to do it.,,,,,,,
,,,,"Miku doesn't care. She said so herself. It'll only be another hour, then I'll head out.",,,,,,,
,,,,No way. You're not doing this alone. Let me help.,,,,,,,
,,,,"…Fine. These are ethernet cables, can you put these in the storage closet? There's a box labeled ethernet on the bottom shelf. ",,,,,,,
,,,,On it~,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey, this is kinda nostalgic, isn't it? Remember when you made me do a bunch of chores overnight?",,,,,,,
,,,,"Nostaglic for *you*, maybe. I had to make sure my dad didn't find out about the teenagers crashing on VISR's couch. That was the only reason you guys got away with it.",,,,,,,
,,,,Yep. Good times.,,,,,,,
,,,,…It was.,,,,,,,
73,,,,Mi~ku!,,,,,,,
,,,,Ugh...,,,,,,,
,,,,Don't 'ugh...' me! I need your advice! Does the synth sound good here?,,,,,,,
,,,,"What makes you think I have anything useful to say? I told you, I don't do music anymore.",,,,,,,
,,,,Because you have ears. Now listen.,,,,,,,
,,,,...,,,,,,,
,,,,"It would be good if I could actually focus on the synth. The drums and bass are too distracting, like a bunch of noise fighting for my attention.",,,,,,,
,,,,"But other than that, it's good? Yay! Thanks, Miku!",,,,,,,
,,,,"Yeah yeah, whatever. Come back when you get someone to mix this properly.",,,,,,,
74,,,,Hey Miku! Guess what Yurina got for me!,,,,,,,
,,,,"Actually, she got it for herself, but then she gave it to me anyway. Love her, she's great.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Dude, I don't care. Go bother Hiroshi about it. ",,,,,,,
,,,,"Ta-da! age of audio's new single, deluxe edition!",,,,,,,
,,,,I don't even want to open it!! The packaging is *so* pretty! Don't you think the cover looks super cool!?,,,,,,,
,,,,"And the vocalist, DIOS, he's literally incredible. I don't know how someone has that much talent. I've been following him since day one, and he has *never* missed. ",,,,,,,
,,,,I'm basically his number one fan—,,,,,,,
,,,,"Miku? Hey, where are you going?!",,,,,,,
,,,,(So rude… Even for her.),,,,,,,
75,,,,So like. What do you even do?,,,,,,,
,,,,That's rude.,,,,,,,
,,,,"I mean, you say you run this place, but there's wasn't anyone here to begin with. Do you just… stand around?",,,,,,,
,,,,"So what, I need a purpose to exist? That's what you're saying? What about you, what do *you* do? ",,,,,,,
,,,,That's not even what I meant! ,,,,,,,
,,,,"Ugh, nevermind. Forget I said anything.",,,,,,,
76,,,,"Okay, internet should be up again. Is it working?",,,,,,,
,,,,"Yep, it is. Thanks, Miku. That was surprisingly helpful of you.",,,,,,,
,,,,Is *everything* a backhanded remark with you?! Can't you say thank you like a normal person?,,,,,,,
,,,,"…Sorry. It's just, uh, I wasn't expecting it.",,,,,,,
,,,,"…Yeah, that's fair. Actually, I just wanted the internet back so I can check Twitter. ",,,,,,,
,,,,?! You have a Twitter? Is that allowed?? ,,,,,,,
,,,,"No one's stopped me yet. Also, you really should get USBs for your sets. You can't rely on streaming forever.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Yeah yeah, I'll get on that. Thanks again. ",,,,,,,
,,,,(Now I kinda wanna know her handle…),,,,,,,
77,,,,It kinda sucks that we can't take your things to the real world. I wanna try those CDJs in somewhere like VISR.,,,,,,,
,,,,"You are actually shameless. Those are *my* things, they're not just for you to take wherever.",,,,,,,
,,,,"But it's not like you even use them. I'd return them after, and you wouldn't even know they were gone.",,,,,,,
,,,,And I'm helping you clean up at the same time! It's like a trade. My labor for your equipment.,,,,,,,
,,,,I didn't ask you to do that. Don't take my things without permission.,,,,,,,
,,,,"Okay, okay, point recieved.",,,,,,,
78,,,,"Miku, your wires are all super frayed. Isn't there a better way to tie them up?",,,,,,,
,,,,"Look, I did the best I could. I had to use cable ties to get it to stay in place. It's too dense to do anything with.",,,,,,,
,,,,We could try braiding them! Or keeping it up in a bun? Could be cute~,,,,,,,
,,,,Hmph. I'd like to see you try. ,,,,,,,
,,,,Bet. I'll buy some more cable ties and be back tomorrow. ,,,,,,,
,,,,Ugh… I walked into that.,,,,,,,
,,,,"Fine. But no cutting anything, and no dying my hair.",,,,,,,
79,,,,Did you do all this?,,,,,,,
,,,,You're welcome. Took forever to sort all those wires. Did you really just dump everything into one big storage bin?,,,,,,,
,,,,"So what if I did? Why are you even here, anyway? Don't you have a livehouse to run?",,,,,,,
,,,,"Nothing's scheduled for today, so I have time.",,,,,,,
,,,,"And *someone* has to do something about this mess. I'm not going to let Hiroshi and Mayuko run around on a messy stage, whether it's here or VISR.",,,,,,,
,,,,Hmph. Whatever. Your problem now.,,,,,,,
80,,,,Huh?,,,,,,,
,,,,"(I was going to get rid of all the boxes here, but someone beat me to it?)",,,,,,,
,,,,There. I did my part. Now get out of here.,,,,,,,
,,,,Why did you do that? I had set out the rest of my afternoon to—,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yeah, that's the point. If you're not driving yourself crazy over VISR, you're driving yourself crazy over this place. ",,,,,,,
,,,,So I handled this room for you. Now get out. Enjoy your youth. ,,,,,,,
,,,,This is just one room. The rest of the SEKAI is still a giant mess—,,,,,,,
,,,,Raika. Get out. Or I'll make you.,,,,,,,
,,,,"…Jesus, no need to be dramatic. I'm leaving.",,,,,,,
81,,,,Waaaah… I'm hopeless… I'm nothing… ,,,,,,,
,,,,"? Hey Hiroshi, is Mayuko okay? What happened?",,,,,,,
,,,,She failed her math quiz yesterday. Just give her a couple of days and let her do her thing. ,,,,,,,
,,,,That's it? She looks like she saw someone die.,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey, get up. You're just gonna sit here and mope around for the next week? ",,,,,,,
,,,,*sniff* Yes… This is a good place to mope. ,,,,,,,
,,,,"It was only one quiz, right? That doesn't make you nothing. Figure out what you did wrong and apply it to the next one.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Hiroshi can help you study. Hiroshi, you gonna help her study, right?",,,,,,,
,,,,"Huh? I mean, yeah, sure. If she's up for it. ",,,,,,,
,,,,…,,,,,,,
,,,,Okay! Let's study right now!,,,,,,,
,,,,"Wait, right now?!",,,,,,,
,,,,"Yeah! If I'm going to get better, I need to start studying for the next one ASAP! I'll go get my textbooks!",,,,,,,
,,,,"…And she's gone. Seriously, Miku, be careful. You're lucky she didn't crash harder. ",,,,,,,
,,,,And you need to tell her what she needs to hear. ,,,,,,,
,,,,…Whatever. At least she pulled herself together. It's weird seeing her so mopey.,,,,,,,
82,,,,You two were working together on music?! Without me?!,,,,,,,
,,,,We weren't working *together.* We were literally just in the same room. Half of the time she was scrolling Twitter. ,,,,,,,
,,,,That's totally together!! Miku never hangs out with me!,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yeah, cuz you talk my head off. At least Hiroshi knows when to be quiet. ",,,,,,,
,,,,"No fair. You probably told him to be quiet, and he was too nice to say no.",,,,,,,
,,,,That's not what happened.,,,,,,,
,,,,Oh. Still not fair!!!,,,,,,,
,,,,"Ugh. If you wanted to join us, then you could've just asked, instead of making a big fuss of it.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Wait, really? Yay ★ Can I join?",,,,,,,
,,,,Too late. I'm exhausted. You two have fun.,,,,,,,
,,,,Miku!!!!,,,,,,,
,,,,Good job. You scared her off.,,,,,,,
93,,,,"So they're cupids, but they kill people?",,,,,,,
,,,,"Nonono, they have guns instead of bows. Their goal is still to help people fall in love, but sometimes they get into gunfights with each other.",,,,,,,
,,,,"…Still, it's really, really good. It's been on my cosplan list for a while. ",,,,,,,
,,,,Hmm… They do look nice. I like the white-haired look.,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'll check it out, then. Can I borrow your copy?",,,,,,,
,,,,"!!! Yes, of course! I have the other volumes, too.",,,,,,,
,,,,"For our weapons, I was thinking we could use EVA foam and PVC pipes, and then airbrush it so it looks smooth, so that…",,,,,,,
,,,,"—Wait, hold on, we can't have a photoshoot with fake weapons! We'll cause a panic!",,,,,,,
94,,,,…Where'd you get that?,,,,,,,
,,,,This button pin? A girl in my class gave it to me. Do you know what this is supposed to be?,,,,,,,
,,,,"VISR'… no, I never heard of it. It looks, um, homemade.",,,,,,,
,,,,That's putting it nicely. I think she got confused and thought we were trading. I just wanted to give her my business card.,,,,,,,
,,,,"…Wait, why did you have business cards?",,,,,,,
,,,,"What do you mean? For networking, obviously. If I want to survive in the real world, I'll need to make connections.",,,,,,,
,,,,(I think you're both confused…) ,,,,,,,
95,,,,"Oh, look at that! Miku's on the big screen up there.",,,,,,,
,,,,"It looks like she's having a concert soon. How does that work? No way it's like our Miku, right..?",,,,,,,
,,,,"No, not like that. It's all prerecorded, and they use holograms to make it look like she's real. ",,,,,,,
,,,,"Still, it's really fun. It's basically the same as a regular concert. I still have my lightsticks from a couple years ago.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Hm… I've always wanted to go to a concert, but I don't think I should be buying tickets right now.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Besides, we have our own Miku. I bet she'd love to give us a show. Maybe we should set up our own concert in SEKAI.",,,,,,,
,,,,That's a fun idea… I'll let her know.,,,,,,,
96,,,,"Koharu, have you ever been here?",,,,,,,
,,,,A sewing cafe? I haven't heard of this before…,,,,,,,
,,,,"It's a really nice place. I came here once, but the sewing machines are too complicated for me... You might like it, though.",,,,,,,
,,,,I don't blame you. Those things are seriously difficult. It took me a long time just to learn how to load the bobbin.,,,,,,,
,,,,"I know, how about we go together? I can teach you how to set it up, and we could get some work done together.",,,,,,,
,,,,…If you promise not to get frustrated.,,,,,,,
,,,,"Of course I won't! We'll make a day of it, it'll be fun.",,,,,,,
97,,,,"Oh, you look perfect!! Exactly how I imagined!!!",,,,,,,
,,,,"Again, thank you so much for doing this! I promise this won't take up too much time. After this, you'll be free.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Really, it's fine… Actually, I should be thanking you. I've never been a model before. ",,,,,,,
,,,,Of course! I hope you like the clothes.,,,,,,,
,,,,"I've only ever modeled for myself or my little sister, so I really wanted to try designing for someone new. ",,,,,,,
,,,,"Still, you did really well. It's cool you can make your own clothes.",,,,,,,
,,,,"I mean, I like sketching, but to have your designs in real life…",,,,,,,
,,,,"I figured it can only help my portfolio. I can't sew all my designs, though, so I have to pick my best.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Alright! Photoshoot time. Follow me, I found a good spot.",,,,,,,
98,,,,"Honestly, I don't know how safe it is to work on our cosplays here.",,,,,,,
,,,,"It only takes MEIKO collapsing the wrong building, and all our work would be for nothing. ",,,,,,,
,,,,"But the SEKAI goes back to normal after Miku and MEIKO have their battle, right? So they should be okay?",,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes, but it still feels risky… and I don't want for Miku and MEIKO to finish fighting just to grab our things.",,,,,,,
,,,,"That's true… If we need to, I can probably save our outfits in my room. My parents won't mind.",,,,,,,
,,,,Really? Don't you have your model kit collection?,,,,,,,
,,,,I've been meaning to take them down to dust my shelves. I can rearrange my room while I'm at it and make space.,,,,,,,
,,,,"*sigh* Thanks, Chiyomi. At least we won't have to worry about debris in our cosplays.",,,,,,,
99,,,,"Do you really need to sprint all the way here? You spend half of the commute on the bus, anyway.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Of course I do! The bus is slow enough as is, I can't keep everyone waiting.",,,,,,,
,,,,You'll just wear yourself out before we can even start the meeting. The five minutes you save isn't worth it.,,,,,,,
,,,,"Aww, Koharu, you're so considerate! But seriously, it's fine. It's actually pretty fun.",,,,,,,
,,,,"I like to time myself and see how fast it takes me to make it. My best time is 4.49, but that was because it was a half day and there wasn't much crowd.",,,,,,,
,,,,You sound like a racehorse. I don't understand how people just run for fun. ,,,,,,,
,,,,"It's not that bad! A good jog is about as intensive as dancing is, anyway.",,,,,,,
,,,,How about we go on a run together one day? I know some good routes on the way here!,,,,,,,
,,,,Eugh… maybe. One day. In the far future.,,,,,,,
100,,,,,,,,,,,
101,,,,,,,,,,,
102,,,,(Oh! Sanae is there. Looks like she went shopping—),,,,,,,
,,,,(IS SHE BLEEDING?????? BLEEDING FROM THE MOUTH??????),,,,,,,
,,,,SANAE??? ,,,,,,,
,,,,"Huh? Oh! Hi Koharu, nice seeing you here!",,,,,,,
,,,,What the hell happened to you??? Why are you bleeding??,,,,,,,
,,,,"Ahaha, about that… I was in a rush to buy groceries, and I tripped on the pavement.",,,,,,,
,,,,"But there was a sale on vegatables, so it was worth it.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Are you insane? Do you think you're being cute, walking around with a split lip? Wait here, I'll ask one of the stores if they have bandages.",,,,,,,
,,,,You really don't have to—,,,,,,,
,,,,Don't even start with that. I'll be right back.,,,,,,,
119,,,,Chiyomi? Whatcha doing hiding over here?,,,,,,,
,,,,O-Oh… ,,,,,,,
,,,,A Switch? Is that allowed?,,,,,,,
,,,,Probably not. But it's better than scrolling Tricktrick for all of lunch.,,,,,,,
,,,,"…Yeah, that's fair. That's what I do most of the time.",,,,,,,
,,,,This looks way better though! Can I join?,,,,,,,
,,,,"! Yeah, of course! I'll load a game we can play together.",,,,,,,
120,,,,"Hey, I hope you don't mind if I ask, but why are you in the credit system?",,,,,,,
,,,,"I mean, I know you leave after the second period, but you never talk about it.",,,,,,,
,,,,…I have support classes for math. ,,,,,,,
,,,,"They said it would be easier to switch to the credit system than try to fit all the classes I need in a schedule, so…",,,,,,,
,,,,"That makes sense. Honestly, I dunno why people think it's for idols only. The credit system's way better in general.",,,,,,,
,,,,"More people should be in the credit system, just because they can.",,,,,,,
,,,,…That would be nice. ,,,,,,,
,,,,(At least then it might not feel as intimidating…),,,,,,,
121,,,,"Hey, Chiyomi, look at this.",,,,,,,
,,,,Oh! Can badges of the new Lovcure. Do they have Mitsuki?,,,,,,,
,,,,…Doesn't look like it. They have Countess Null though. I'm gonna give it a try.,,,,,,,
,,,,"I don't get why they leave her out. She's just as important as the main duo. It's obvious she's going to be a late season Cure, anyway…",,,,,,,
,,,,"Um, Kaori, should we go now..?",,,,,,,
,,,,"No, wait, one more. I'll get her on the next one.",,,,,,,
,,,,(Oh no… She's been trapped…),,,,,,,
122,,,,That was fun. I think we got some progress done.,,,,,,,
,,,,"…But seriously, girl, you have to relax. No one's watching us all the way out here.",,,,,,,
,,,,I don't know how you're so nonchalant… You're literally a public figure. Shouldn't you be worried someone's gonna see you?,,,,,,,
,,,,"Wow, what a scandal. 'Umetsu's daughter caught practicing a dance routine in the middle of the park.' *That's* sure to make the headlines.",,,,,,,
,,,,Mm… But still…,,,,,,,
,,,,"Don't worry about me. If something happens, I'll handle it. Come on, once more!",,,,,,,
123,,,,You got the binoculars? ,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yep. They're kinda old though, they're my dad's old birding binoculars.",,,,,,,
,,,,"That's fine, as long as they work. I got snacks and eye protection.",,,,,,,
,,,,I don't think that counts as eye protection.,,,,,,,
,,,,"We'll be fine~ We probably won't need it, as long as we stay away from any unstable buildings.",,,,,,,
,,,,Alright! Operation 'Stormchasing a magical girl battle' is a go! Let's find Miku and MEIKO!,,,,,,,
124,,,,"Oh, Chiyomi, you're having lunch over here? Nice.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Actually, I wanted to ask if I missed anything important. I just got back, and there was some buzz about a quiz…",,,,,,,
,,,,Ah. I'm skipping school…,,,,,,,
,,,,Seriously? You got a fever or something? ,,,,,,,
,,,,…Just didn't feel like it. ,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey, more power to you. I'll go back out and see if one of our classmates can share notes.",,,,,,,
,,,,"I'll pass it along to you, too. Let's study together later!",,,,,,,
131,,,,Koharu~~★ Welcome back~~★,,,,,,,
,,,,"Ah! You don't look so good. Actually, you look really upset! ",,,,,,,
,,,,…Thank you for noticing.,,,,,,,
,,,,"That won't do! Come on, let's go to the stage, I'll show you the dance I've been working on! It'll cheer you right up—",,,,,,,
,,,,AHHH!!! She collapsed!! ,,,,,,,
,,,,"Miku, please calm down. I just wanted to lie down. ",,,,,,,
,,,,"…Look, Miku. I'm sure your dance is nice, but I just got off my shift. I'm not up for it right now…",,,,,,,
,,,,"Oh, okay! As long as you're okay~",,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks, Miku. But, um, you don't need to lie down too. ",,,,,,,
,,,,Nope! Not letting you be on the floor alone. It's 'lie down and stare at the sky' time now.,,,,,,,
,,,,"…Actually, sure. Lie down and stare at the sky time is great.",,,,,,,
153,,,,"Toshiki, Toshiki, look at this!",,,,,,,
,,,,? Is this your picshare page?,,,,,,,
,,,,"No, it's some COPYCAT!!! I can't believe her. She totally STOLE. MY. LOOK.",,,,,,,
,,,,…I'm not understanding. How did she 'steal your look'?,,,,,,,
,,,,Just LOOK!! She has the SAME SHOES and everything!!!,,,,,,,
,,,,"Oh… It just looks like a clown outfit to me. The shoes are similar, but I don't think it's the exact same…",,,,,,,
,,,,"Sigh… You're too innocent for this world, Toshiki. You have to be on the lookout for people like this!",,,,,,,
,,,,Or else — BAM! — you'll get knocked down! Crushed underfoot! Like a bug.,,,,,,,
,,,,"…I think this is beyond me. And I haven't gotten crushed like a bug yet, so I think I'm fine.",,,,,,,
154,,,,…Really? You want to go shopping with me?!,,,,,,,
,,,,*Nod* Or at least windowshopping. ,,,,,,,
,,,,"My wardrobe is… somewhat dull, compared to yours. I want to try something new.",,,,,,,
,,,,!!!!!!!,,,,,,,
,,,,"TOSHIKI!!! Mark my words, we're going to dress you up so PRETTY!!! ",,,,,,,
,,,,You're going to be a WHOLE new man! You're gonna be the TALK of SHIBUYA!!!,,,,,,,
,,,,…Maybe not something so dramatic. I just want to try something different.,,,,,,,
,,,,But thank you. I'm looking forward to it.,,,,,,,
155,,,,(I messed up just before the bridge…),,,,,,,
,,,,"(Usually, I would've started over then and there, but people were watching… How irritating…)",,,,,,,
,,,,"(It's fine. I'll do it again, perfectly this time—)",,,,,,,
,,,,TOSHIKI!!!,,,,,,,
,,,,?! Ami? Where did you come from?,,,,,,,
,,,,"Damn, Rion was right, you *are* always practicing. I wanted to see for myself!",,,,,,,
,,,,"Anyway, can I join you? I bought my guitar!",,,,,,,
,,,,(No… I didn't plan for company…),,,,,,,
,,,,(…But it could be fun. I should at least give it a try.),,,,,,,
,,,,Sounds good. I'll help you set up.,,,,,,,
169,,,,KEISHIRO!!! Wanna grab lunch with me? ,,,,,,,
,,,,"Oh! Sorry, Ami, I packed a lunch today…",,,,,,,
,,,,"And I'm waiting for Hiroshi, so we can go over notes. You should come sit with us when you're done, though! ",,,,,,,
,,,,Oh… ,,,,,,,
,,,,"Ahaha, nevermind!!! You have fun! I'm gonna go bother someone else~",,,,,,,
,,,,Ami—?,,,,,,,
,,,,(She ran off…),,,,,,,
,,,,"(She's fine having lunch together when it's the four of us, but when it comes to anyone else… I hope there isn't any bad blood between them…)",,,,,,,
170,,,,WOAH. What happened to your salmon? It's burnt to a crisp!,,,,,,,
,,,,"Oh, uh. I tried to cook it myself. The recipe online said to cook for 20 minutes, but 5 minutes in, it started to look like this…",,,,,,,
,,,,You must've had the flame *really* high for it to get that charred. Are you sure the inside's cooked?,,,,,,,
,,,,"I mean, it's still edible! And anyway, I can't let it go to waste, so—",,,,,,,
,,,,"Absolutely NOT!!!! That thing's a lost cause. Come on, let's get something from the cafeteria!",,,,,,,
,,,,Aww…,,,,,,,
171,,,,"Come on, the light's gonna turn red!!!",,,,,,,
,,,,"Ami, *stop!*",,,,,,,
,,,,What'd you do that for?? We could've totally made it!,,,,,,,
,,,,"No, we wouldn't! Don't run in the road like that!! What if you got hit?!",,,,,,,
,,,,"Relax, I do it, like, all the time. I haven't gotten run over yet ★",,,,,,,
,,,,?,,,,,,,
,,,,"Ok, ok, if you're THAT worried, I won't try it again. It'll suck if I can't play cuz all my bones are broken.",,,,,,,
,,,,Thank goodness…,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hehe, you're such a mom. But hurry it up next time! ",,,,,,,
172,,,,,,,,,,,
208,,,,"Yurina, how long have you had your hair dyed?",,,,,,,
,,,,"Some years. I've only been green for a couple of months, though. Why, wanna get your hair done?",,,,,,,
,,,,"I was thinking about it! Imagine how cool I'd look ★ Hiro, you should dye your hair too!",,,,,,,
,,,,It could be fun…,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hold on, does Miya's even allow you to dye your hair? Don't get yourself kicked out. ",,,,,,,
,,,,"It might depend on how obvious it is. As long as your not, like, rainbow. What color were you thinking?",,,,,,,
,,,,"Umm, I dunno. Maybe white?",,,,,,,
,,,,…,,,,,,,
,,,,*Seriously?*,,,,,,,
,,,,"It's not like that! Forget about DIOS for a second, you don't think it'll look super cool!?",,,,,,,
,,,,"You're already cool. Just stay purple. Yurina, tell her to stay purple. ",,,,,,,
,,,,"I don't think I could do white, anyway. With hair as dark as yours, it'll take forever to get it right. ",,,,,,,
,,,,Aww…,,,,,,,
,,,,"Oh well, I'll think of a different color then.",,,,,,,
225,,,,Kaori's out today…,,,,,,,
,,,,That's a shame. I needed to ask about adjusting her outfit. ,,,,,,,
,,,,Really? I thought everything was finalized.,,,,,,,
,,,,Chiyomi was thinking about removing the line of spikes under the arms here. It might be uncomfortable for her if we're going with hard plastic.,,,,,,,
,,,,"Oh, I see. In the show it looks cool, but if you actually keep your hands at your side, it'll poke you. ",,,,,,,
,,,,"It's either that, or we make it out of something softer. I'm just worried about it wearing down. ",,,,,,,
,,,,"It shouldn't really matter, right? It's not like she's wearing it regularly, or running marathons in it.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Still, I'm leaving it up to her. Let's get in the classroom before a teacher sees us.",,,,,,,
229,,,,…How long is Sanae gonna stay hidden? It's not like they know she's here.,,,,,,,
,,,,She told me she waits 10 minutes afterwards to be safe. Sometimes she moves around if she thinks the teachers' already checked a spot. ,,,,,,,
,,,,She's actually insane. She's lucky there isn't a warrant on her.,,,,,,,
,,,,"Maybe we should help her out. If we create a distraction, she can sneak out with all the noise.",,,,,,,
,,,,You just want to cause trouble.,,,,,,,
,,,,"Koharu, since you're such a good student, why don't you help out? You can be the bait.",,,,,,,
,,,,You just want to get *me* in trouble!,,,,,,,
,,,,I can be the bait. I'd be such a good bait. ,,,,,,,
,,,,"…Oh, nevermind, Sanae's back. Maybe next time, Chiyomi.",,,,,,,
230,,,,Should we just go inside without her?,,,,,,,
,,,,"No, too risky… If Sanae gets caught, it's easier to say she was with one of us.",,,,,,,
,,,,"Oh yeah, I remember. When we first met, I had to bail her out cuz she got caught trying to sneak in. ",,,,,,,
,,,,She basically owes me her life~ ,,,,,,,
,,,,Don't be weird. Why would you help a stranger sneak into the school? What if she was dangerous?,,,,,,,
,,,,"I was bored, and it looked like something interesting was happening. And it was, wasn't it? Everything's gotten so exciting since we found the SEKAI.",,,,,,,
,,,,"It has! I mean, even without the SEKAI…",,,,,,,
,,,,I'm happy we get to hang out like this.,,,,,,,
,,,,I guess I can't be mad about that. ,,,,,,,
