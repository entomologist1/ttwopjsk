ok wait i guess ill put it here. i took a sql class last semester and now i've got it in my head to make a website on my ocs. so this is just some test files

demo_image/demo is for actual vn style stuff that is finalized 

demo_convolist is for placing in world ✔️

test_image and test_convolist are for testing on a smaller scale ✔️

waaaa this is so embarrassing T_T but i cant make this repo private bc its a pain to get a key everytime
